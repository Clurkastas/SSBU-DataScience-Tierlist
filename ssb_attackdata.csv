"2","Mario","Neutral attack","","2.2%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Super Mario 64. The first and second hits can lock, and the general speed of the move makes it good as a grounded combo breaker or quick punish tool, as the first hit comes out on frame 2."
"3","Mario","Neutral attack","","1.7%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Super Mario 64. The first and second hits can lock, and the general speed of the move makes it good as a grounded combo breaker or quick punish tool, as the first hit comes out on frame 2."
"4","Mario","Neutral attack","","4%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Super Mario 64. The first and second hits can lock, and the general speed of the move makes it good as a grounded combo breaker or quick punish tool, as the first hit comes out on frame 2."
"5","Mario","Forward tilt","","7%","A wheel kick. It can be angled. Good for getting opponents off of Mario due to its high base knockback, and angling it down enables it to hit ledge hangs."
"6","Mario","Up tilt","","5.5%","A spinning uppercut. Effective for comboing into itself at low percents, and into aerial attacks from mid to high percents; however, the former combo can be escaped with the proper combination of DI and SDI, and can be punished on hit at very low percents. Unlike in SSB4, the move's altered animation results in the hitbox being positioned fairly high to the ground on the first frame it is active, making it fairly difficult or even impossible to hit shorter or crouching characters with the move. It appears to be based on the second hit of the Mega Glove's combo from Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars."
"7","Mario","Down tilt","","5% (foot), 7% (leg)","A legsweep. A reliable combo starter that works at a wider range of percents than up tilt, at the cost of being less consistent due to its different hitboxes, and unable to combo into itself as effectively. Can also hit ledge hangs and combo off from ledge as well."
"8","Mario","Dash attack","","8% (clean), 6% (late)","A baseball slide. Has a vertical knockback angle, although its moderate endlag makes it subpar for starting combos. Its lingering hitbox is useful for 2-framing certain opponents and punishing spotdodges. Very similar to the Slide Kick from Super Mario 64."
"9","Mario","Forward smash","","17.8% (fire), 14.7% (arm)","Steps back and does a palm thrust that produces a small explosion. Though it is Mario's slowest ground attack, coming out on frame 15, it is considered among the best forward smashes in the game for several reasons: It is Mario's most powerful KO move when sweetspotted, KOing as low as 65% by the ledge, the fireball itself is disjointed, can be angled downwards or upwards to hit ledge hangs, and the start-up animation has Mario pull back his hurtbox deceptively far, inadvertently allowing him to avoid several attacks."
"10","Mario","Up smash","Lead Headbutt","14%","An upward arcing headbutt. One of Mario's most reliable KO options. Its quick startup makes it a useful out of shield option, as well as being difficult to react to if the opponent is within its range. His head is intangible while its hitboxes are active, giving it pseudo-disjointed range. Its hitboxes reach behind Mario a good distance, but do not reach as far in front of him. Has very fast interruptibility for its strength at frame 40, and its damage output is also just enough to make it difficult for most characters to punish out of shield."
"11","Mario","Down smash","","10% (front), 12% (back)","The Sweep Kick from Super Mario 64. Mario does a breakdance kick that hits both sides. Mario's fastest smash attack, coming out as fast as all his tilts, and both hits semi-spike opponents, though the frontal hit is rather weak in comparison to the back hit. Also capable of hitting ledge hangs. The animation in Ultimate more closely resembles Mario's breakdance from Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix."
"12","Mario","Neutral aerial","","8% (clean), 5% (late)","A flying kick. As a sex kick, it loses its already below-average power after the first frames. It is useful for breaking out of combos due to its very fast startup (frame 3), and as a versatile horizontal combo extender, as well as for locking opponents. Autocancels in a short hop. Can combo into a tilt attack or grab at low percents if landing on the ground shortly after the hit. Very similar to the Jump Kick from Super Mario 64."
"13","Mario","Forward aerial","Meteor Knuckle","12% (early), 14% (clean), 10% (late)","Rears back his fist and then throws an overhand. When hit clean, it is a meteor smash with enough knockback to KO under 45% offstage. It has the slowest startup of his standard moveset (frame 16), high ending lag, and is Mario's only aerial that doesn't autocancel in a short hop."
"14","Mario","Back aerial","","10.5% (clean), 7% (late)","A dropkick behind Mario. Has decent knockback, fast startup with low ending and landing lag, and more range than most of Mario's other aerials, making it an effective spacing tool and horizontal combo extender at low percents, as well as having the ability to pseudo Wall of Pain off stage. Also capable of killing at higher percents, and can be used twice in a short hop, or with neutral, up and down airs."
"15","Mario","Up aerial","","7%","A flipkick. Has extremely fast startup (frame 4), consistent strength throughout the move and very low ending and landing lag, making it one of Mario's most versatile combo starters and extenders in his moveset. Can combo into itself easily until higher percents, and can kill off the top at high percents when close to the upper blast line."
"16","Mario","Down aerial","Mario Tornado","1.4% (hits 1-5), 5.5% (hit 6), 2% (landing)","Rapidly spins around, trapping opponents and damaging them with a series of discus clotheslines and spinning backfists before assuming a spread-eagle position to launch them. It can combo at low percents with the final hit, whilst possessing very low endlag, making the move rather safe to use, barring its low range. However, the move's hitboxes do not reliably trap opponents, especially when falling. It also has a landing hitbox that combos reliably into tilts or grab. It resembles the Spin Jump, a technique that first appeared in Super Mario World. Useful as a combo starter and damage-racking option, and can KO the opponents near the upper blast zone at high percentages."
"17","Mario","Grab","","—","Reaches out. Mario's overall grab range is somewhat short."
"18","Mario","Pummel","","1.3%","Headbutts the opponent."
"19","Mario","Forward throw","","8%","Spins the opponent around once and throws them forward. Can be followed up with dash attack at lower percents, or be used to set up tech situations and mixups, or edgeguards. It fails to kill at very high percents, even at ledge."
"20","Mario","Back throw","Airplane Swing","11% (throw), 8% (collateral)","Spins the opponent by their legs three times before throwing them backward. Can KO even the heaviest of characters reliably at around 160% near the edge without the need of rage, but can KO middleweights as early as 120% if they fail to DI. Also has some use in matches with more than one player, as the collateral hit has large range and high knockback. Due to its slow speed, it is easy to DI, causing it to KO only above 160%. It is based on the throw that he uses against Bowser in Super Mario 64."
"21","Mario","Up throw","","7%","Heaves the opponent directly overhead with both hands. An effective combo throw at low to medium percentages, comboing into all aerials except forward air. Very similar animation to the Upward Cap Throw from Super Mario Odyssey."
"22","Mario","Down throw","","5%","A body slam. It can be followed up with several options, including up tilt on certain characters at varying percents, Super Jump Punch, neutral attack, and up aerial at mid percents on most characters. Effective for starting ladder combos on platform stages."
"23","Mario","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Performs a modified version of the Sweep Kick from Super Mario 64 before getting up."
"24","Mario","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Punches behind himself and then in front of himself while getting up."
"25","Mario","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Performs a side kick behind himself and then in front of himself while getting up."
"26","Mario","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a dropkick while climbing up."
"27","Mario","Neutral special","Fireball","5% (early), 4% (late)","Throws a Fireball. The fireball bounces along the ground several times before disappearing. Has a lot of endlag for how weak it is, but Mario retains full control over his aerial mobility while using it, allowing him to continue drifting unpredictably while controlling space. Because the fireball is subject to gravity, it can be used to cover Mario while recovering high, and can combo into quick attacks if Mario is close enough."
"28","Mario","Side special","Cape","7%, 1.5x times the reflected projectile","Dons a Cape and waves it in front of himself. It reflects projectiles and reverses enemies, as well as reversing the opponent's controls for a brief instant. In the air, it stalls Mario for a short period of time, allowing for timing mixups in juggle and recovery situations. Useful for gimping opponents who are trying to recover."
"29","Mario","Up special","Super Jump Punch","5% (hit 1), 0.6% (hits 2-6), 3% (hit 7)","A jumping uppercut that produces Star Coins or Metro Kingdom regional coins on contact. Mario's only recovery move. Its extremely fast startup (frame 3) and intangibility frames on startup make it useful as an out of shield option. Can KO near the upper blast line at high percents."
"30","Mario","Down special","F.L.U.D.D.","0%","Wields F.L.U.D.D. and charges up water to launch a stream at the opponent. The charge time is rather fast, and it can be charge canceled and stored for later. The water pushes opponents, but does not damage them. Mario can change the angle of the stream upwards or downwards. Useful for disrupting an approach and creating space, which can help alleviate pressure and potentially put his opponent in a vulnerable position. It also slightly pushes Mario backward if charged enough. Can also be used as an edgeguarding tool."
"31","Mario","Final Smash","Mario Finale","2% (early), 2.5% (clean), 3% (late)","Rears his arms back before thrusting them forward to generate and launch two gigantic Fireballs, which trap and repeatedly damage any opponents in their path. Deals almost no knockback, but has decent damage and can carry opponents off the side of the stage when near the ledge."
"32","Luigi","Neutral attack","","2%","A one-two combo followed by a hip bash. It hits on frame 2 and its last hit slightly moves Luigi forward, making it a safe option at close range. The first two hits can also be used for jab locking opponents. The first two hits originate from the Punch + Punch + Kick combo."
"33","Luigi","Neutral attack","","2%","A one-two combo followed by a hip bash. It hits on frame 2 and its last hit slightly moves Luigi forward, making it a safe option at close range. The first two hits can also be used for jab locking opponents. The first two hits originate from the Punch + Punch + Kick combo."
"34","Luigi","Neutral attack","","4%","A one-two combo followed by a hip bash. It hits on frame 2 and its last hit slightly moves Luigi forward, making it a safe option at close range. The first two hits can also be used for jab locking opponents. The first two hits originate from the Punch + Punch + Kick combo."
"35","Luigi","Forward tilt","","9%","A side kick. It can be angled."
"36","Luigi","Up tilt","","6%","A leaping uppercut, similar to Mario's, but more in front of Luigi rather than directly above himself. It is a potent combo starter, leading into itself at low percents and all of Luigi's aerials at mid to high percents. Compared to Mario's, it deals more damage, has more frontal range and less ending lag, but its much lower base knockback makes it less safe at very low percents."
"37","Luigi","Down tilt","","5%","A crouching kick. It has short range, and deals low damage and knockback. However, its very minimal lag allows it to be quickly used in succession to combo into itself and whittle down shields if the opponent is close enough to Luigi."
"38","Luigi","Dash attack","","2% (hits 1-4), 4% (hit 5)","Performs a flurry of punches, all while wincing nervously. It has been considerably improved from previous games, having significantly less ending lag and dealing both more damage and knockback, while still being one of the fastest dash attacks in the game in terms of startup, coming out at frame 4."
"39","Luigi","Forward smash","","15%","Does a small step backwards, then moves forward and quickly thrusts his hand in front of him to attack with his fingers and performing a knifehand thrust, a move used in karate. Luigi's most powerful smash attack, dealing high damage and very high knockback scaling on all angles. It is his slowest grounded attack, but it is one of the fastest forward smashes, coming out on frame 12. However, it has short range, making it difficult to land."
"40","Luigi","Up smash","Lead Headbutt","14% (clean), 12% (late)","An upward arcing headbutt. It is quite fast for a smash attack, coming out on frame 9, making it one of Luigi's fastest KO options, and launches opponents at a vertical angle towards him. Like Mario and Dr. Mario's up smashes, it renders his head intangible throughout its duration. Unlike theirs, however, it consists of a sweetspot and a sourspot, the latter which is located closer to Luigi."
"41","Luigi","Down smash","","15% (body), 14% (legs)","A breakdancing kick, hitting on both sides of himself. Luigi's fastest smash attack, at frame 6, rivaling his tilts in speed, but also his weakest. In an opposite fashion to his up smash, both hits possess sweetspots located closed to Luigi, with the sourspots covering the rest of his legs."
"42","Luigi","Neutral aerial","Luigi Kick","12% (clean), 6% (late)","A flying kick. It has the fastest startup out of Luigi's aerials at frame 3, making it very useful for breaking out of combos. It also launches at a vertical angle, allowing it to start combos when SHFF'd, especially with its late hit. The clean hit possesses an above average damage output and high knockback, giving it good KO power."
"43","Luigi","Forward aerial","","8%","A downward knifehand strike, a move used in karate. Very fast, coming out on frame 7. It is a reliable followup from down throw at low to medium percents, and is useful for edgeguarding and approaching due to its  extremely low ending lag, with only 14 frames. Its hitbox is positioned not only on Luigi's hand, but also slightly around his body. Overall one of the fastest moves of its type."
"44","Luigi","Back aerial","","14% (clean feet), 8% (clean legs, late)","A dropkick. The clean hit's sweetspot is located on Luigi's feet and deals high damage and great knockback, making it one of Luigi's best KOing options. Conversely, the clean hit's sourspot and the late hit deal much less damage and knockback. It comes out quickly on frame 6, but has noticeable ending lag, with 33 frames of lag, the highest of Luigi's aerials."
"45","Luigi","Up aerial","","11% (clean), 7% (late)","A bicycle kick. It is useful for combos like Mario's up aerial, due to its low ending and landing lag, while dealing above-average damage for a combo move. However, it launches at a lower angle than Mario's, which makes it less effective for combos and juggling past low percents. It also comes out one frame later than Mario's, at frame 5 instead of 4. Due to its lenient autocancel window and low ending lag, Luigi can use this move twice in a single short hop and still autocancel it."
"46","Luigi","Down aerial","","10% (clean), 8% (late)","A diagonal corkscrew dropkick. It comes out on frame 10, has low landing lag, very low ending lag and a clean hit that meteor smashes with respectable power, making it a safe edgeguarding option and a fast but powerful meteor smash with low risk and good reward. It also has the lowest ending lag of any meteor smash in the game, with only 15 frames of lag. However, said clean hit only affects the hitbox on Luigi's feet and only lasts one frame, whereas the late hit is less reliable due to launching opponents horizontally away from Luigi. Prior to update 2.0.0, the clean hit could affect both grounded and aerial opponents, which allowed it to start combos at a wide variety of percents, even possessing KO setups into Super Jump Punch. From the update onward, it only affects aerial opponents, removing nearly all its potential as a combo starter; however, it can still function as a valuable combo extender from a down throw or neutral aerial, launching opponents back to the ground and into more followup attacks."
"47","Luigi","Grab aerial","Suction Shot","5%","Fires a plunger from his Poltergust G-00. It behaves unusually from other grab aerials in that it cannot be used as a tether recovery, and the plunger alongside its string detach from the Poltergust G-00 after being fired forward, behaving as a projectile that is affected by gravity and cannot be reflected or absorbed, which makes it useful for edgeguarding. The plunger falls down until either landing on the ground or traveling a set distance, disappearing afterwards, and does not restrict Luigi from using his grab while active. Unlike other grab aerials, this move has a much higher landing lag of 20 frames, but if Luigi lands before firing the plunger, it can come out and hit opponents during landing lag, allowing it to combo into several ground attacks at close enough range."
"48","Luigi","Grab","Suction Shot","—","Fires a plunger from his Poltergust G-00. Has shorter range than other extended grabs, but less ending lag, with Luigi being able to act out of it before the plunger disappears."
"49","Luigi","Pummel","","1.3%","Squeezes the opponent with the Poltergust G-00. Much quicker than his previous pummel, but does less damage."
"50","Luigi","Forward throw","Slam","9%","Slams the opponent forward with the Poltergust G-00. Luigi's second most damaging throw, but has limited utility outside of dealing damage and setting up edge-guards at high percents. Based on the Slam ability from Luigi's Mansion 3."
"51","Luigi","Back throw","Slam","10%","Turns around to slam the opponent behind himself with the Poltergust G-00. It is Luigi's most damaging and strongest throw, being able to KO middleweights under 120% at the edge. Based on the Slam ability from Luigi's Mansion 3."
"52","Luigi","Up throw","","8% (throw), 6% (collateral)","Swings the Poltergust G-00 upwards. It can combo into a forward aerial or up aerial at low to mid percents, and possesses a collateral hitbox that launches bystanders upwards alongside the thrown opponent."
"53","Luigi","Down throw","","3% (hit 1 and throw)","Shoves the opponent under himself and Ground Pounds them. It is Luigi's most useful attack one of the most effective combo starters in the game, thanks to its average knockback, low ending lag and mostly vertical angle. It can combo into several moves, including an up tilt or up smash at low percents, and any of Luigi's aerials or Luigi Cyclone at low and up to high percents, as well as an aerial sweetspotted Super Jump Punch. Its most effective followup at lower percents is a clean down aerial, followed up by a neutral aerial into another clean down aerial, before finally ending with an up aerial into a Super Jump Punch for a zero-to-death combo that works on a wide variety of characters. At higher percents, it has several potential KO setups, including an aerial Super Jump Punch, a back aerial near the edge, and Luigi Cyclone on platforms."
"54","Luigi","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Performs a breakdancing kick before getting up."
"55","Luigi","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Punches behind himself and then in front of himself while getting up."
"56","Luigi","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Performs a wheel kick while getting up."
"57","Luigi","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a double-footed legsweep while climbing up."
"58","Luigi","Neutral special","Fireball","6% (clean), 5% (late)","Throws a Green Fireball. It is fairly spammable, which enables it to pressure opponents from afar and hinder approaches. It deals more damage than Mario's Fireballs and is unaffected by gravity, which gives it more vertical range, but it is less suitable for edgeguarding."
"59","Luigi","Side special","Green Missile","˜6.16% (uncharged), ˜21% (fully charged), 25% (misfired)","Crouches and then shoots himself forward to perform a flying battering ram. It takes more than a full second to fully charge, but deals impressive damage upon doing so. Upon reaching full charge, it has KO potential and can be held for some time before being automatically canceled. It also has a 10% chance to misfire, which deals considerably more damage and knockback, KOing opponents at around 60% from the center of Final Destination; this is known as Overzealous Green Missile. A misfired Green Missile, also grants intangibility on frames 18-22, and always travels the same distance regardless of the charge. However, its considerable ending lag makes it punishable whether it is used for offense or recovering, which makes reads very important in order to use it effectively."
"60","Luigi","Up special","Super Jump Punch","25% (grounded sweetspot), 20% (aerial sweetspot), 1% (sourspot)","A jumping uppercut. Its grounded sweetspot emits a ping sound and triggers a Special Zoom upon hitting, and boasts excellent damage output with impressive knockback, KOing opponents from 37% to 67% depending on weight from ground level. Its aerial sweetspot is larger, yet deals less damage and knockback (though it is still powerful), and does not have the special effects of the grounded sweetspot. Both versions also grant intangibility for three frames, starting frame 8 on the ground and frame 6 in the air. However, it is very punishable because of its considerable landing lag, while its abysmally weak sourspot lacks KO potential."
"61","Luigi","Down special","Luigi Cyclone","2% (hits 1-4), 4% (hit 5)","Rapidly spins around as a vortex generates around himself, trapping the opponent and damaging them with a series of discus clotheslines and spinning backfists before assuming a spread-eagle position to launch them. It allows Luigi to move horizontally on the ground, as well as rise by mashing the special move button, although both abilities are considerably weaker than in previous games. It also grants Luigi invincibility during startup (frames 4–8 while grounded and 1–7 in midair), and has windboxes around Luigi to pull opponents into the attack, making it a potent combo breaker that, compared to his neutral aerial, is more effective but slightly less rewarding. The final hit has respectable power, with the grounded version KOing middleweights at around 160%. It should also be noted that Luigi Cyclone now requires consistent mashing for all hits to connect."
"62","Luigi","Final Smash","Poltergust G-00","30.1% (maximum captured), 10% (ejection)","Wields the Poltergust G-00 to vacuum nearby opponents into it before powerfully ejecting them diagonally. Opponents will accumulate more damage the earlier they are vacuumed in. It has decent range, and is capable of vacuuming opponents from a variety of angles."
"63","Peach","Neutral attack","","2%","Slaps the enemy twice with her leading arm: the first being an inward forehand slap, and the second being an outward backhand slap. At low percentages, the first hit can lock."
"64","Peach","Neutral attack","","3%","Slaps the enemy twice with her leading arm: the first being an inward forehand slap, and the second being an outward backhand slap. At low percentages, the first hit can lock."
"65","Peach","Forward tilt","","7% (early, clean leg), 8% (clean foot)","Kicks forward 180 degrees from low to high. Has good range for a forward tilt, and unusually for an attack of its type, launches opponents vertically, allowing it to perform air combos and juggles."
"66","Peach","Up tilt","","10% (blast), 8% (arm)","Extends her arm upward, creating a discharge of pink magic in the form of a heart."
"67","Peach","Down tilt","","7%","A low sweep kick. This move meteor smashes grounded opponents. A decently strong attack with moderate startup that can follow up into a forward smash at lower percents, forward or up aerials at mid-percents, and into an up special at higher percents. Due to the removal of teching for grounded meteor smashes, Peach's down tilt has better combo potential."
"68","Peach","Dash attack","","4% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Creating magical sparks in her hands, Peach strikes with both arms extended forward, then quickly spreads her arms out."
"69","Peach","Forward smash","","18% (frying pan), 15% (golf club), 13.5% (tennis racket)","Strikes with a bludgeon, depending on the angle of the attack: angling upward uses the frying pan, angling downward uses the tennis racket, and no angling uses the golf club. Each weapon has different properties—the frying pan has more vertical knockback (and the most damage), the golf club has more diagonal knockback (and the most range), and the tennis racket has more horizontal knockback and is a strong semi-spike."
"70","Peach","Up smash","Ribbon Dance","12% (ribbon), 17% (heart)","Raises her arm and twirls a pink ribbon. A heart appears at the tip of the ribbon, which is where the sweetspot is located. Her head and arm become intangible for the duration of the move (frames 14-20)."
"71","Peach","Down smash","","2% (hits 1-6), 3% (hit 7)","Peach does a counterclockwise spin on her leg and utilizes the edge of her dress, slashing multiple times."
"72","Peach","Neutral aerial","","13% (clean), 6% (late arms), 5% (late body)","Spins around at an angle with arms extended, dealing damage to her left and right sides. The late hit can lock."
"73","Peach","Forward aerial","","15% (crown), 14% (arm)","Peach grabs the crown off her head and strikes with it in a vertical arc with red and turquoise magic sparkles emerging from the crown. Has the slowest startup out of all her aerial attacks. However, it is also her strongest aerial if sweetspotted. Her arm possesses a sourspot that deals 1% less damage, and KOs much later."
"74","Peach","Back aerial","","12% (clean), 10.2% (mid), 7% (late)","Peach strikes behind her by thrusting her rear. She creates a heart, although it is aesthetic, and possesses no hitbox. At low percentages, even the clean hit can lock."
"75","Peach","Up aerial","","4% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Swipes above her head with her arms from left to right, creating two magic rainbow trails. When low floating, only the second hit will hit medium to large opponents, while small characters avoid it entirely."
"76","Peach","Down aerial","","2% (hits 1-3), 5% (hit 4)","Rapidly kicks straight downwards four times. Depending on how the last hit lands, may launch opponents behind her. From a short hop, it can even combo another down aerial after her double jump."
"77","Peach","Grab","","—","Reaches out with her arm. An average grab, though Toad appears when Peach has grabbed an opponent."
"78","Peach","Pummel","","1.3%","Toad punches the opponent."
"79","Peach","Forward throw","","2% (hit 1), 8% (throw)","Toad leaps forward, headbutting the opponent away."
"80","Peach","Back throw","","2% (hit 1), 9% (throw)","Places opponent behind her and bumps them away with her rear. Toad is present, mimicking Peach's rear thrust, but does not contribute any damage. Peach's strongest throw, and the only one that can KO at reasonable percents."
"81","Peach","Up throw","","2% (hit 1), 6% (throw)","Puts opponent above her, and strikes them upward. Toad leaps up with Peach, but does not hit the opponent."
"82","Peach","Down throw","","1% (hit 1), 7% (throw)","After putting the opponent on the ground, Toad leaps up and headbutts them, sending them upward and behind Peach. Good for starting combos, as it can lead to her back air and forward tilt at low to mid percents."
"83","Peach","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swirls around in a similar fashion to Mario's down smash."
"84","Peach","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings her legs around."
"85","Peach","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Two kicks to either side."
"86","Peach","Edge attack","","9%","While getting up, swipes forward with a hand at ground level."
"87","Peach","Neutral special","Toad","3.5% (per hit)","Peach covers her ears with a terrified expression and turns away as Toad appears in front of her, arms spread out. If hit, Toad will retaliate with a spray of spores, and Peach will wince. If attacked from behind, Peach and Toad switch places."
"88","Peach","Side special","Peach Bomber","12%","Peach lunges her body forward to deliver a powerful bash with her rear. Upon impact, she rebounds away from the victim, allowing for hit-and-run tactics. Deals considerable shield damage. Smash-inputting the move has her travel further."
"89","Peach","Up special","Peach Parasol","3% (first hit), 1% (hits 2-5), 2% (last hit), 2% (open)","Peach jumps upward and then opens her parasol, jabbing those above her in the process. It can then be used as a directional glide but can also be opened or closed at will."
"90","Peach","Down special","Vegetable","Varies","Plucks a Super Mario Bros. 2 Vegetable from the ground. She can then throw it as a projectile item. Its face determines how much damage it will do; the rarer the expression, the stronger the turnip. Along with turnips, Peach can rarely pull out Mr. Saturns and Bob-ombs."
"91","Peach","Final Smash","Peach Blossom","30% (close), 20% (mid), 10% (far)","Peach performs a dance, causing all of her enemies to fall asleep. The closer they are to her when she activates it, the more damage they will take and the longer they will slumber. Three giant peaches appear, healing 20%. This Final Smash fails to affect anyone outside the range of the screen borders."
"92","Bowser","Neutral attack","","4%","Bowser performs a sumo-style palm strike, followed by a punch. Both hits of neutral attack have decent speed, and deal decent damage in total. Bowser's arms each have intangibility (frames 7 and 8, and frames 9-11, respectively)."
"93","Bowser","Neutral attack","","7%","Bowser performs a sumo-style palm strike, followed by a punch. Both hits of neutral attack have decent speed, and deal decent damage in total. Bowser's arms each have intangibility (frames 7 and 8, and frames 9-11, respectively)."
"94","Bowser","Forward tilt","","13%","Bowser does a swung backhanded punch, with his arm slightly bent. The punch may be angled up or down, but doing so has no effect on damage or knockback.  Has damaged-based armor (frames 7-9) and intangibility on his arm (frames 10-14)."
"95","Bowser","Up tilt","","11%","Does an arcing claw swipe. Comes with wide range and average ending lag, allowing it to combo into itself at low percents. At slightly higher percents, it can combo into neutral air and back air. The attack will almost always send the opponent directly above Bowser. Has damage based armor (frames 8-10) and makes Bowser's arm intangible (frames 11-16)."
"96","Bowser","Down tilt","","7% (hit 1),8% (hit 2)","Does an alternating pair of hooks. Both hits deal 15% in total, only slightly higher than the first hit's damage output in SSB4, being 14%. Down tilt's second hit comes out five frames earlier, and gains the ability to trip opponents. Also grants damaged-based armor on the first hit (frames 7-9), and intangibility on his arms for both (frames 10-12, and 10-14, respectively). It can still hit many ledge hangs, although the first hit having set knockback can cause the second hit to whiff if a ledge hang is low enough."
"97","Bowser","Dash attack","","12% (clean),10% (late)","A side kick, similar to Meta Knight's dash attack. Good for hitting prone or tumbling opponents and has high base knockback. However, its knockback scaling is below-average, preventing it from KOing until around 190%, along with having high ending lag, making it very punishable."
"98","Bowser","Forward smash","","23% (clean feet),20% (clean body),17% (late feet),14% (late body)","A dropkick. Its outstanding damage output threatens shields, being able to inflict significant damage to them. When spaced properly, it can even hit opponents hanging on an edge or lingering just below it. It grants damaged-based armor (frames 17-21), and the clean hitboxes render Bowser's feet invincible (20-25), whereas its late hitboxes have anti-rebounding priority. The fourth strongest forward smash in the game, it can KO opponents at 63% from center stage."
"99","Bowser","Up smash","","22% (spikes),16% (sides), 12% (landing)","Hops to thrust his shell upwards while spinning. Deals the most damage to opponents who come into contact with Bowser's top spikes, while other opponents get hit by the edge sourspots or landing hitbox instead. Its sweetspot is among the strongest up smashes in the game, KOing at around 80% uncharged. Grants damaged-based armor (frames 11-15) and invincibility on his shell (frames 14-27), making it an excellent anti-air tool that is hard to compete with."
"100","Bowser","Down smash","","16% (hit 1),15% (hit 2)","Does two grounded claw swipes, hitting opponents in front then behind him. Active on frame 12, making it Bowser’s fastest smash attack. Deals high knockback, with the front hit being slightly stronger than the back hit. Grants damaged-based armor (frames 5-11), but unlike his other smashes, it possesses no invincibility. It can hit many characters' ledge hangs and is useful for covering rolls."
"101","Bowser","Neutral aerial","","6% (hits 1-4)","An aerial cartwheel. While its looping hits are hard to connect altogether, it is incredibly damaging for an aerial, and it can even open up KO confirms on landing, such as into forward aerial, back aerial and up aerial. This makes it Bowser's best combo starter when landing with it, as even at low percentages it is able to combo into up tilt and up smash."
"102","Bowser","Forward aerial","","13% (hand),12% (arm),11% (body)","Swipes downward with his claws. It has quick start-up, a respectable damage output, can pseudo-wall of pain with Whirling Fortress as a finisher, and great range, as it can even hit opponents below him. It can also auto-cancel from a short hop. Altogether, these traits make for, arguably, Bowser's most versatile aerial."
"103","Bowser","Back aerial","","19%","A dropkick. It is very powerful, as it can either KO around 100% from center-stage and as low as 60% at the edge, though it does not have much vertical range. It can auto-cancel in a short hop, making it somewhat safe when retreating. However, it has very high landing lag, making it risky to use when close to the ground. Active on frame 9."
"104","Bowser","Up aerial","","15%","An upward headbutt. Deals great knockback, enough to KO at around 100% near the upper blast line, and makes it a good juggling tool. Grants intangibility in his head (frames 3-13)."
"105","Bowser","Down aerial","","16% (spikes),2% (shockwave)","A stall-then-fall attack that involves Bowser retreating into his shell while turning upside-down, then propelling himself towards the ground while spinning on a vertical axis. The first few active frames being able to meteor smash opponents, in combination with the move's large hitbox and respectable diagonal knockback during the later active frames, make it a moderately effective edgeguarding tool. The move emits a small shockwave on both sides when Bowser lands, which makes the move slightly harder to punish. Should Bowser use the move while he's off stage, it is almost guaranteed to cause a self-destruct. Bowser will hover in the air for a brief period before the active frames begin, allowing this move to stall Bowser’s landing. Grants intangibility on his arms and legs in midair (frames 14-60) and upon landing (frames 1-27)."
"106","Bowser","Grab","","—","Reaches out."
"107","Bowser","Pummel","","1.6%","Headbutts the opponent."
"108","Bowser","Forward throw","","12%","Places the opponent in between his horns, rears his head back, and then powerfully sways his head forward to launch the opponent. It is the strongest forward throw in the game, KOing around 120% near the edge. However, it doesn't throw until frame 36, which results in it taking longer to throw opponents than back throw, making it more susceptible to DI."
"109","Bowser","Back throw","","12%","Throws the opponent backward in a sideways motion. It has the exact same damage output and knockback values as his forward throw, which make it a viable KOing option around 120% near the edge. However, its throw hitbox is active on frame 19, enabling it to throw opponents earlier than forward throw."
"110","Bowser","Up throw","","0.5% (hits 1-7),2% (hit 8),4% (hit 9)2% (throw)","Throws the opponent slightly upward, withdraws into his shell, and then spins rapidly in order to repeatedly stab them with his shell's spikes. He hops up on the final hit, launching the opponent upward. Can combo into forward or up aerial at low percents. Furthermore, the latter becomes a 50/50 KO setup at high percentages."
"111","Bowser","Down throw","","10% (hit 1),4% (throw)","Places the opponent on the ground and body slams them. Its high base knockback, low knockback scaling, and high ending lag prevent it from having any follow-ups. However, its very high damage and base knockback make it a good mixup and an option to send opponents offstage."
"112","Bowser","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swipes his claws behind himself and in front of himself while stumbling to his feet."
"113","Bowser","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swipes his claws around himself while getting up."
"114","Bowser","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swipes his claws around himself while getting up."
"115","Bowser","Edge attack","","10%","Bowser slowly climbs up from the ledge, then swipes at the ground in front of him. Has by far the longest range out of any edge attack."
"116","Bowser","Neutral special","Fire Breath","1.8%xN","Expels a stream of fire from his mouth. It gradually loses strength and range, but will slowly regain its strength when not in use. It can be angled upward or downward, which can potentially gimp recovering opponents, although the flames at the very end of the stream do not cause flinching. It deals notoriously high damage, as at close ranges it can potentially deal over 30% in a matter of a few seconds."
"117","Bowser","Side special","Flying Slam","18% (throw),15% (collateral)","Grabs an opponent, jumps with them into the air and backflips before belly-to-belly suplexing them onto the ground, causing an explosion effect. Bowser spins around dramatically during the descent. It deals immense vertical knockback that can KO at 120%, making it a very reliable KOing option. Its power and launching angle makes it difficult to properly DI, especially if the user has high gravity. The suplex can also hit other opponents on the ground that it lands into for similarly powerful knockback. It can be used to dive off-stage with the opponent for a potential sacrificial KO, although it is possible to recover if the opponent has a good vertical recovery. The ascent grants intangibility (frames 1-23), and can launch opponents significantly far when falling, although the explosion has no hitbox."
"118","Bowser","Up special","Whirling Fortress","1% (grounded hits 1-7),4% (grounded hit 8),7% (aerial hit 1),1% (aerial hits 2-11),2% (aerial hit 12)","Withdraws into his shell and spins around rapidly. It is capable of moving forward or backward while doing so, which makes it a very useful out of shield option. In the air, it propels Bowser diagonally upward, making it a very effective horizontal recovery but poor vertically. Button mashing at the end can slightly extend the vertical distance."
"119","Bowser","Down special","Bowser Bomb","4% (headbutt),20% (ground pound),11% (landing)","A Ground Pound. It deals immense vertical knockback to anyone hit and can KO under 100%, making it one of Bowser's most reliable KOing options. On the ground, Bowser performs a weak headbutt that drags opponents into the main attack, which is not possible to avoid if hit by it. If performed in the air, Bowser performs the Ground Pound after a brief pause instead of leaping first. Emits a shockwave upon landing and will break full shields if all of its grounded hitboxes connect. It will almost certainly cause a self-destruct if used off-stage due to its ending lag, though it can grab ledges if Bowser is near one. In midair, the startup can meteor smash."
"120","Bowser","Final Smash","Giga Bowser Punch","40%","Bowser transforms into Giga Bowser and teleports into the background, where he becomes impervious to attacks. Red crosshairs will appear on screen to indicate where Giga Bowser will aim his punch, which can be moved around with the control stick; the crosshairs also contains a depleting green gauge around their circumference to indicate how much time is left until the attack will activate automatically, though the attack can be activated manually before the gauge fully depletes. If the opponent's damage percent is 60% or greater before they are punched, they are instantaneously screen K.O.d."
"121","Dr. Mario","Neutral attack","","2.9375%","Two punches, followed up by a kick. Useful for spacing and comes out quickly. The first and second hits can jab lock."
"122","Dr. Mario","Neutral attack","","1.7625%","Two punches, followed up by a kick. Useful for spacing and comes out quickly. The first and second hits can jab lock."
"123","Dr. Mario","Neutral attack","","4.7%","Two punches, followed up by a kick. Useful for spacing and comes out quickly. The first and second hits can jab lock."
"124","Dr. Mario","Forward tilt","","8.225%","A wheel kick. Like neutral attack, it is useful for spacing. Can be angled. Can lock at low percentages."
"125","Dr. Mario","Up tilt","","7.4025%","A spinning uppercut. Can combo into itself at low percentages, and into aerials at higher percentages. At high percentages (around 140-150%), it can serve as a KO option, although it fails to hit most short opponents due to its high hitbox placement."
"126","Dr. Mario","Down tilt","","5.875% (foot), 8.225% (leg)","A legsweep. A decent combo starter, although unsafe on hit at low percents, and typically only combos into up aerial or Super Jump Punch if done correctly."
"127","Dr. Mario","Dash attack","","11.515% (clean), 7.05% (late)","A baseball slide. Launches opponents vertically unlike Mario's version, which can potentially make it a combo starter if hit late."
"128","Dr. Mario","Forward smash","","17.2725% (electricity), 20.915% (arm)","Steps back, then does a palm thrust that produces electricity. Deals immense damage and knockback, giving it great KO potential. Its sweetspot is located on Dr. Mario's arm. One of the stronger forward smashes in the game, and one of Dr. Mario's most viable KOing options. Its electric properties also make it safer on shield compared to Mario's, especially if spaced."
"129","Dr. Mario","Up smash","Ear, Nose, and Throat","16.45%","An upward arcing headbutt. Unlike most up smashes, this one launches opponents horizontally in the opposite direction he is facing. Renders Dr. Mario's head intangible for a short time. The horizontal angle allows the move to combo into itself at low percentages and KO earlier at the ledge, although it weakens its potential as an anti-air and punishment tool."
"130","Dr. Mario","Down smash","","11.75% (front), 14.1% (back)","A 360º breakdance sweep kick. Dr. Mario's fastest smash attack, making it a rather useful defensive option. Its back hit is stronger, and can punish ledge stalls effectively. It can also semi-spike with above-average knockback, making it a great edgeguarding tool."
"131","Dr. Mario","Neutral aerial","Dr. Kick","5.875% (clean), 9.4% (late)","A sex kick that has the unique property of having its late hit being stronger than its clean hit. Its clean hit can jab lock and start combos, while its late hit has good edgeguarding potential."
"132","Dr. Mario","Forward aerial","Dr. Punch","11.75% (early), 17.625% (clean), 10.575% (late)","Throws an overhand punch. Unlike Mario's version, it does not have a meteor smash hitbox. It has slow startup (tied with his down aerial for the slowest of his other aerials), high ending and landing lag, and is the only aerial that cannot autocancel in a short hop, but it has extremely high diagonal knockback when hit clean, making it one of the strongest forward aerials in the game. Can KO middleweights as early as 70% near the edge."
"133","Dr. Mario","Back aerial","","14.1% (clean), 8.225% (late)","A dropkick. Comes out quickly and has above-average knockback, which makes it a viable edgeguarding and KO move and a reverse aerial rush option. Can also chain into itself at low percents, or set up tech-chase situations."
"134","Dr. Mario","Up aerial","","10.2225%","A bicycle kick. The move launches diagonally unlike Mario's up aerial, which can be ideal for edgeguarding mixups. However, this renders it unusable for juggling and lengthy combos past low percentages. It can be used twice in a single short hop, or the second up aerial can be replaced with a neutral aerial instead. Despite its very quick startup, it works well as a KO option at high percentages, especially offstage."
"135","Dr. Mario","Down aerial","CLEAR!","14.1%","Performs a double foot stomp similar to those of Captain Falcon and Ganondorf. While it has noticeable startup, it can powerfully meteor smash opponents when hitting with the sweetspot in the legs. It has a sourspot on his hips, which launches away instead. On grounded opponents, the meteor hitbox can open up many KO confirms, notably with forward aerial, back aerial, Super Jump Punch and Dr. Tornado; however it can be difficult to hit as it only has one active frame."
"136","Dr. Mario","Grab","","—","Reaches out. Has average range and above average speed."
"137","Dr. Mario","Pummel","","1.5275%","Headbutts the opponent. Moderately fast."
"138","Dr. Mario","Forward throw","","9.4%","Spins and throws the opponent away. Can be used to set up an edgeguard, or combo into dash attack against certain characters at 0%. Decently quick."
"139","Dr. Mario","Back throw","","12.925%","Dr. Mario heaves the opponent over him and then throws them diagonally. Combined with its high damage and knockback, it is one of the strongest back throws in the game, having potential to even surpass Ness's back throw by a small margin when at the ledge. Can KO middleweights at around 90% near the edge."
"140","Dr. Mario","Up throw","","8.225%","Heaves the opponent upward. Can put the opponent into a juggling situation. Can combo into up aerial and Dr. Tornado at low percentages."
"141","Dr. Mario","Down throw","Hospital Bed","5.875%","Throws the opponent down to the ground. As it launches opponents directly upward unlike Mario's version, it is one of Dr. Mario's best combo starters, being useful for setting up aerial combos and can even has KO setups into forward aerial and Super Jump Punch, although both require a read. It can KO at percentages as low as 60% if followed up with Dr. Tornado at the sides of the stage, though this is also reliant on reads. It also has KO setups into up aerial and back aerial."
"142","Dr. Mario","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Sweepkicks, then gets up. Identical to Mario's."
"143","Dr. Mario","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Punches on both sides, then gets up. Identical to Mario's."
"144","Dr. Mario","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Sweepkicks, then gets up. Identical to Mario's."
"145","Dr. Mario","Edge attack","","10%","Performs a dropkick while climbing up. Identical to Mario's, though it deals more damage."
"146","Dr. Mario","Neutral special","Megavitamins","5.875% (early), 4.7% (late)","Throws a Megavitamin. Useful approach and pressure option. Unlike Fireball, it cannot be absorbed, bounces on a different trajectory, and does not have a flame effect. At higher percentages, it launches opponents slightly upward, which potentially can make it a combo starter, and even opens up into KO setups if timed correctly."
"147","Dr. Mario","Side special","Super Sheet","8.225%, 1.6x times the reflected projectile","Flips his white sheet upward. Can turn opponents around (which also temporarily reverses their controls and aerial momentum) and can function as a reflector, which deals more damage than Mario's variant due to Dr. Mario's attack multipliers. However, it does not stall Dr. Mario's descent in midair, making it useless for recovery unlike Cape."
"148","Dr. Mario","Up special","Super Jump Punch","14.1% (clean), 7.05% (late)","A jumping uppercut. It functions better as an attack than a recovery option, as it has great KO potential and fast startup, which can make it a deadly out of shield option. However, it travels a short distance compared to Mario's version."
"149","Dr. Mario","Down special","Dr. Tornado","1.88% (hits 1-6), 3.525% (final hit)","A series of clothesline spins. Can hit up to seven times, with the final hit sending opponents diagonally. This move can be used to aid in recovery, as mashing the B button will make Dr. Mario rise up. The maximum height that can be gained from this move is greater than that of Super Jump Punch, although this requires extremely fast button mashing. It gains good vertical and horizontal distance if mashed fast enough. As an attack, it is notorious for being able to KO very early at the sides of the stage (around 45% at earliest) due to its extremely high knockback growth on its last hit. As such, it is a deadly edgeguarding tool, although it is a bit risky due to Dr. Mario's poor recovery."
"150","Dr. Mario","Final Smash","Doctor Finale","3.1% (front Megavitamin), 2.3% (back Megavitamin)","Similar to Mario Finale, but the fireballs are replaced with huge Megavitamins with their respective sounds, and their trails consist of red, yellow, and blue pixelated streaks and circles. Slightly stronger than Mario Finale."
"151","Bowser Jr.","Neutral attack","","2%","The Junior Clown Car performs a one-two combo, followed by a flurry of punches, followed by a jab. It has impressive damage racking potential, as it can easily deal around 20%. Its first hit is quite useful for jab locks due to its minimal ending lag, whereas its last hit's extremely high knockback growth can KO around 130%-150% while near the edge. However, its neutral infinite is quite easy to escape, even with minimal SDI, while its last hit is punishable. As a result, it is best used against off-stage opponents that are attempting to grab the edge."

"155","Bowser Jr.","Up tilt","","6%","The Junior Clown Car thrusts a pitchfork upward. It can combo into itself beginning at 0% and juggle at medium percentages."
"156","Bowser Jr.","Down tilt","","2% (hits 1-2), 6% (hit 3)","The Junior Clown Car uses its tongue to lick forward three times. It has a fair amount of utility, as it is efficient at warding off rushdowns, can act as a set-up for a dash attack, or interfere with an opponent attempting to grab an edge due to its undulating hitbox."
"157","Bowser Jr.","Dash attack","","1.8% (hits 1-5), 4% (hit 6)","The Junior Clown Car opens its mouth to swing a Grinder twice. Its loop hits do not connect together very well at high percentages."
"158","Bowser Jr.","Forward smash","Smash Twin Drills","1% (hits 1-5), 11% (hit 6)","The Junior Clown Car uses two drills to drill the opponent in place. The final hit is a powerful KOing option, while the whole move has low ending lag and it can be angled."

It is Bowser Jr.'s fastest smash attack, with its multiple hits being useful for pressuring shields or denying aerial approaches."
"160","Bowser Jr.","Down smash","","18%","The Junior Clown Car slams wrecking balls on both sides. It is Bowser Jr.'s most powerful smash attack, and is the third strongest down smash in the game, making it deadly for punishment. However, it has high ending lag unlike his other smash attacks, making it equally as punishable."
"161","Bowser Jr.","Neutral aerial","","8% (clean), 7% (mid), 5% (late)","The Junior Clown Car spins around with the boxing glove arms extended. It is a weak but useful aerial, which combos reliably from Clown Kart Dash and is effective as a anti-pressure and edgeguarding option."
"162","Bowser Jr.","Forward aerial","","11%/9% (clean), 8%/6.5% (mid), 5%/4% (late), 2% (landing)","The Junior Clown Car swings a wrecking ball forward in a circling motion. Landing while the wrecking ball is still out produces another hitbox, which can lead to more follow-ups on the ground, as well as compensate for its high landing lag. Useful for edge-guarding and spacing, as well as a viable KOing option."
"163","Bowser Jr.","Back aerial","","14% (clean tip), 8% (clean base, late)","The Junior Clown Car thrusts a wrecking ball backward. Like his forward aerial, landing while the wrecking ball is still out produces another hitbox, which can lead to more follow-ups on the ground. Useful for edge-guarding and a viable KOing option due to its high knockback."
"164","Bowser Jr.","Up aerial","","10% (clean), 6.5% (late)","Swings a hammer above himself. It has little lag and is a useful juggling option."
"165","Bowser Jr.","Down aerial","","1.5% (hits 1-8), 2.5% (last), 2% (landing)","The Junior Clown Car extends a drill from its underside hatch to pierce opponents. Its high ending lag is compensated by the hitbox it produces upon landing, which grants it follow-up potential. If the attack hits an opponent, it can cancel quickly into other moves; if not, Bowser Jr. suffers from moderate ending lag."
"166","Bowser Jr.","Grab","","—","The Junior Clown Car extends a claw to grab the opponent. A slow grab overall."
"167","Bowser Jr.","Pummel","","1.3%","Hits the opponent with a toy hammer. A fairly fast pummel. The toy hammer looks identical to the one used in the Eekhammer sticker from Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Each hit plays the recurring sound of Mario jumping onto a Goomba in the Super Mario franchise."
"168","Bowser Jr.","Forward throw","","3% (hit 1), 7% (throw)","The Junior Clown Car throws an uppercut. It is fairly good for launching opponents at the edge for an edge-guard."

It can be charged to increase the cannonball's speed and power. At the end of its path, the cannonball will drop to the ground, which can hit opponents attempting to recover if it is spaced properly. However, it has high overall lag."
"177","Bowser Jr.","Side special","Clown Kart Dash","5.2%-8.8% (collision), 10%-16.3% (doughnut)","The Junior Clown Car transforms into a go-kart that speeds forward. Tilting the control stick/circle pad in the opposite direction or pressing the attack/special button will cause the Junior Clown Car to perform a doughnut, which deals more damage and has higher knockback to opponents on contact compared to simply charging into them. Spinning out in the air can produce horizontal movement, after which it can be used again. All versions of the move can be jump canceled, even right after hitting an opponent, which can lead into combos and mix-ups."
"178","Bowser Jr.","Up special","Abandon Ship!","5% (contact), 13% (explosion), 15%/10% (hammer)","Bowser Jr. ejects himself from the Junior Clown Car. The Junior Clown Car slowly falls to the ground and then explodes with high power when the move is used in midair, whereas it will simply explode after a brief period when used on the ground. When Bowser Jr. is out of the Junior Clown Car, he is not rendered helpless and can still attack with a hammer (or in the case of the Koopalings, their respective wands), which is powerful enough to KO at medium to high percentages. However, taking any weak hit while out of the Junior Clown Car prevents another use of the move without button mashing or landing."
"179","Bowser Jr.","Down special","Mechakoopa","2% (contact), 7% (explosion)","The Junior Clown Car drops a Mechakoopa from its underside hatch. The Mechakoopa falls in a strong downward arc; once it lands, it starts walking around. If it reaches a wall or dead end, it will turn around and walk in the opposite direction. If it makes contact with an opponent (or travels enough distance in the air without landing), it will detonate. Lastly, if enough time passes and they have not hit an opponent yet, they will spark out and detonate automatically. They can be picked up and thrown as items either by Bowser Jr. or his opponent."
"180","Bowser Jr.","Final Smash","Shadow Mario Paint","3% (paint), 5% (explosion)","Bowser Jr. transforms into Shadow Mario and uses the Magic Paintbrush to paint a giant, orange X on the screen. Anyone caught in the X's hitbox will be damaged, with the X pulling opponents into it once they are hit. The X will clear away with an explosion after some time. The sheer size of the X makes avoiding damage from this Final Smash difficult, similarly to Iceberg."
"181","Roy","Neutral attack","Slash","4.8%/7.5%","A reversed gripped upward slash. A great combo starter, due to launching at a rather high angle and having low knockback and ending lag. It can easily start combos into a grab, tilts, aerials, Double-Edge Dance or Blazer."
"182","Roy","Forward tilt","Sharp Edge","12.5% (sweetspot), 9% (near), 8% (far)","A reversed gripped downward slash. Comes out on frame 8 with somewhat low ending lag. Very powerful for a tilt considering its speed, being capable of KOing at under 130% from center-stage when sweetspotted."
"183","Roy","Up tilt","","7%/12%","A reversed gripped overhead arcing slash. Like forward tilt, it has remarkably good speed and power when sweetspotted, capable KOing at around 120%. However, the ending lag is quite high, making whiffs punishable."
"184","Roy","Down tilt","Low Stab","6.5%/11%","A kneeling thrust, identical to Marth and Lucina's down tilts, but with lower range. Can set up a tech-chase due to launching at a semi-spike angle."
"185","Roy","Dash attack","","9%/13%","An inward horizontal slash across the ground. Very strong for a dash attack, KOing at around 110% near the ledge. However, it has noticeable startup and ending lag, which makes it very unsafe on shield."
"186","Roy","Forward smash","","20% (close), 17% (mid), 12% (far)","Rotates his body to perform a lunging, two-handed downward slash. Despite coming out rather quickly (frame 13), it has extremely high damage and knockback and is one of the strongest forward smashes in the game when sweetspotted, capable of KOing as low as 40% with max rage. However, it has high ending lag and a short duration."
"187","Roy","Up smash","Flame Sword","2%/1% (hit 1), 2% (hits 2-4), 10% (hit 5)","An upward thrust, which ignites the Binding Blade's tip and concludes with a small explosion. A good anti-air attack as Roy's sword arm is granted intangibility throughout the attack, though mediocre for ground combat due to it having small horizontal hitboxes. Has enough power to KO at around 100% uncharged."
"188","Roy","Down smash","","10%/15% (front hit), 11%/17% (back hit)","A kneeling outward slash in front of himself and then behind himself. Roy's fastest smash attack when it comes to startup, but has the highest ending lag of the three. The back hit is stronger than the front hit. The front and back hits KO at around 120% and 100% near the ledge, respectively."
"189","Roy","Neutral aerial","Double Slash","4%/6% (hit 1), 5%/8.5% (hit 2),","An inward slash followed by a spinning, outward slash. Deals decent damage and is a useful combo extender, and is Roy's main aerial approach tool due to its high amount of active frames. The first hit can start guaranteed combos, though it can be difficult to setup due to how fast it ends. Interestingly, it is set apart from identical neutral aerials in that the second hit possesses fixed knockback, KO'ing characters at the exact same percentages regardless of their weight."
"190","Roy","Forward aerial","","7%/11%","A downward slash. It comes out on frame 10 with the lowest amount of ending lag of Roy's aerials, auto-cancels from a short hop, and has KO potential at high percentages. It can also be used in quick succession due to its low ending lag, making it possible to perform a wall of pain."
"191","Roy","Back aerial","","9%/12%","Rotates his body to perform an upward slash. Interestingly, it turns Roy around completely, similarly to Marth's and Jigglypuff's back aerials. Has great KO potential at high percentages and is also a devastating edgeguarding tool."
"192","Roy","Up aerial","","6%/9%","A backflipping, upward arcing slash. Useful for juggling, and the sweetspot can even KO at very high percentages. The sourspot can lead into other aerials while falling."
"193","Roy","Down aerial","Half Moon","10%/15%","A two-handed, downward slash between his legs, similar to Ike's down aerial. Has the capability to meteor smash when sweetspotted, though it can be very difficult to aim due to its slim hitbox. It's also risky to use offstage due to Roy's fast falling speed and poor recovery, possibly causing a self-destruct. This move has a flame effect."
"194","Roy","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his free hand."
"195","Roy","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike. A fairly fast pummel."
"196","Roy","Forward throw","","5%","An elbow strike with his sword arm. Has very high base knockback, making it mainly used for sending opponents offstage."
"197","Roy","Back throw","","5%","Tosses the opponent behind himself. Can set up into a KO with his back aerial."
"198","Roy","Up throw","","6%","Heaves the opponent upward with his free hand. Roy's only throw with KO potential, starting around 170%. Can allow up aerial chains at low to mid percents."
"199","Roy","Down throw","Slam","5%","A one-armed body slam. Roy's only combo throw and is very reliable due to the amount of followups it can potentially set up into, though, it has very low hitstun. However, it can follow up into neutral and forward aerial at low percents depending on the opponent's DI."
"200","Roy","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Gets up while slashing to the left and then to the right."
"201","Roy","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Gets into a kneeling position and then slices around himself as he gets up."
"202","Roy","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Hops briskly to his feet to perform a thrust to the left and a slash to the right."
"203","Roy","Edge attack","","8%","Performs an outward slash while climbing up."
"204","Roy","Neutral special","Flare Blade","6%-35%, 36%-50% (fully charged), 10% recoil (fully charged)","Rears back and ignites the Binding Blade before performing a lunging, two-handed downward slash that generates an explosion. Roy can turn while charging the move. Functions similarly to Eruption, as it can be charged before unleashing the explosion, with the explosion's size growing as it charges. It has very high knockback growth even while uncharged, and the ability to quickly increase its damage output via charging. When fully charged, it will OHKO every character in the game, with the exception of Shulk in the Shield Monado Art. A fully charged Flare Blade is also capable of instantaneously breaking a full shield, similar to a fully charged Shield Breaker."
"205","Roy","Side special","Double-Edge Dance","Varies","A sequence of sword slashes with several variations based on directional input. Four slashes total, with each capable of being altered in direction, allowing for eighteen total possible combinations. Standard strikes are trailed red, high strikes are trailed blue, and low strikes are trailed green. While identical to Marth and Lucina's Dancing Blade, its overall knockback is stronger than Dancing Blade, and the last hit of each variation deals flame damage unlike Dancing Blade because of the Binding Blade igniting. The lower-held green strikes deal a fairly large amount of damage and is useful for damaging shields, the upward blue variant is useful for setting up juggle situations, while the final forward-held hit has surprisingly high KO potential, being stronger than Cloud's Limit Cross Slash and being able to kill opponents near the ledge at lower than 80%"
"206","Roy","Up special","Blazer","4%/5.5% (grounded hit 1), 4.5% (aerial hit 1), 1.1% (grounded hits 2-4), 1% (aerial hits 2-4), 7%/8% (grounded hit 5), 6% (aerial hit 5)","A jumping reverse gripped slash, which ignites the Binding Blade. Hits multiple times and can be angled diagonally, though this causes the slash to cover less vertical distance. The grounded version deals more knockback, and has brief super armor before Roy leaves the ground. Roy cannot sweetspot ledges with the move unless he has traveled half of Blazer's maximum distance."
"207","Roy","Down special","Counter","1.35× (minimum 9%)","Parries and then counterattacks against any incoming attacks with an outward slash that ignites the Binding Blade. It has a 1.35× damage multiplier, the third highest of any counterattack in the game by default, with Counter Throw and Gut Check tied for second (1.5×), Tetrakarn in first (1.6×), and Vision surpassing it while the Buster Monado Art is active."
"208","Roy","Final Smash","Critical Hit","1% (hits 1-10), 35% (hit 11)","Swings the Binding Blade in a circular motion, which ignites its blade, before performing a two-handed, downward slash that generates a powerful explosion. Unlike Marth and Lucina's Critical Hit, Roy's is not a one-hit KO unless performed at the ledge. The circular swing can hit up to four times from the front, though it can hit up to ten times if performed on an opponent behind Roy. It is based on the Binding Blade's ranged attack in The Binding Blade."
"209","Bowser","Neutral attack","","4%","Bowser performs a sumo-style palm strike, followed by a punch. Both hits of neutral attack have decent speed, and deal decent damage in total. Bowser's arms each have intangibility (frames 7 and 8, and frames 9-11, respectively)."
"210","Bowser","Neutral attack","","7%","Bowser performs a sumo-style palm strike, followed by a punch. Both hits of neutral attack have decent speed, and deal decent damage in total. Bowser's arms each have intangibility (frames 7 and 8, and frames 9-11, respectively)."
"211","Bowser","Forward tilt","","13%","Bowser does a swung backhanded punch, with his arm slightly bent. The punch may be angled up or down, but doing so has no effect on damage or knockback.  Has damaged-based armor (frames 7-9) and intangibility on his arm (frames 10-14)."
"212","Bowser","Up tilt","","11%","Does an arcing claw swipe. Comes with wide range and average ending lag, allowing it to combo into itself at low percents. At slightly higher percents, it can combo into neutral air and back air. The attack will almost always send the opponent directly above Bowser. Has damage based armor (frames 8-10) and makes Bowser's arm intangible (frames 11-16)."
"213","Bowser","Down tilt","","7% (hit 1),8% (hit 2)","Does an alternating pair of hooks. Both hits deal 15% in total, only slightly higher than the first hit's damage output in SSB4, being 14%. Down tilt's second hit comes out five frames earlier, and gains the ability to trip opponents. Also grants damaged-based armor on the first hit (frames 7-9), and intangibility on his arms for both (frames 10-12, and 10-14, respectively). It can still hit many ledge hangs, although the first hit having set knockback can cause the second hit to whiff if a ledge hang is low enough."
"214","Bowser","Dash attack","","12% (clean),10% (late)","A side kick, similar to Meta Knight's dash attack. Good for hitting prone or tumbling opponents and has high base knockback. However, its knockback scaling is below-average, preventing it from KOing until around 190%, along with having high ending lag, making it very punishable."
"215","Bowser","Forward smash","","23% (clean feet),20% (clean body),17% (late feet),14% (late body)","A dropkick. Its outstanding damage output threatens shields, being able to inflict significant damage to them. When spaced properly, it can even hit opponents hanging on an edge or lingering just below it. It grants damaged-based armor (frames 17-21), and the clean hitboxes render Bowser's feet invincible (20-25), whereas its late hitboxes have anti-rebounding priority. The fourth strongest forward smash in the game, it can KO opponents at 63% from center stage."
"216","Bowser","Up smash","","22% (spikes),16% (sides), 12% (landing)","Hops to thrust his shell upwards while spinning. Deals the most damage to opponents who come into contact with Bowser's top spikes, while other opponents get hit by the edge sourspots or landing hitbox instead. Its sweetspot is among the strongest up smashes in the game, KOing at around 80% uncharged. Grants damaged-based armor (frames 11-15) and invincibility on his shell (frames 14-27), making it an excellent anti-air tool that is hard to compete with."
"217","Bowser","Down smash","","16% (hit 1),15% (hit 2)","Does two grounded claw swipes, hitting opponents in front then behind him. Active on frame 12, making it Bowser’s fastest smash attack. Deals high knockback, with the front hit being slightly stronger than the back hit. Grants damaged-based armor (frames 5-11), but unlike his other smashes, it possesses no invincibility. It can hit many characters' ledge hangs and is useful for covering rolls."
"218","Bowser","Neutral aerial","","6% (hits 1-4)","An aerial cartwheel. While its looping hits are hard to connect altogether, it is incredibly damaging for an aerial, and it can even open up KO confirms on landing, such as into forward aerial, back aerial and up aerial. This makes it Bowser's best combo starter when landing with it, as even at low percentages it is able to combo into up tilt and up smash."
"219","Bowser","Forward aerial","","13% (hand),12% (arm),11% (body)","Swipes downward with his claws. It has quick start-up, a respectable damage output, can pseudo-wall of pain with Whirling Fortress as a finisher, and great range, as it can even hit opponents below him. It can also auto-cancel from a short hop. Altogether, these traits make for, arguably, Bowser's most versatile aerial."
"220","Bowser","Back aerial","","19%","A dropkick. It is very powerful, as it can either KO around 100% from center-stage and as low as 60% at the edge, though it does not have much vertical range. It can auto-cancel in a short hop, making it somewhat safe when retreating. However, it has very high landing lag, making it risky to use when close to the ground. Active on frame 9."
"221","Bowser","Up aerial","","15%","An upward headbutt. Deals great knockback, enough to KO at around 100% near the upper blast line, and makes it a good juggling tool. Grants intangibility in his head (frames 3-13)."
"222","Bowser","Down aerial","","16% (spikes),2% (shockwave)","A stall-then-fall attack that involves Bowser retreating into his shell while turning upside-down, then propelling himself towards the ground while spinning on a vertical axis. The first few active frames being able to meteor smash opponents, in combination with the move's large hitbox and respectable diagonal knockback during the later active frames, make it a moderately effective edgeguarding tool. The move emits a small shockwave on both sides when Bowser lands, which makes the move slightly harder to punish. Should Bowser use the move while he's off stage, it is almost guaranteed to cause a self-destruct. Bowser will hover in the air for a brief period before the active frames begin, allowing this move to stall Bowser’s landing. Grants intangibility on his arms and legs in midair (frames 14-60) and upon landing (frames 1-27)."
"223","Bowser","Grab","","—","Reaches out."
"224","Bowser","Pummel","","1.6%","Headbutts the opponent."
"225","Bowser","Forward throw","","12%","Places the opponent in between his horns, rears his head back, and then powerfully sways his head forward to launch the opponent. It is the strongest forward throw in the game, KOing around 120% near the edge. However, it doesn't throw until frame 36, which results in it taking longer to throw opponents than back throw, making it more susceptible to DI."
"226","Bowser","Back throw","","12%","Throws the opponent backward in a sideways motion. It has the exact same damage output and knockback values as his forward throw, which make it a viable KOing option around 120% near the edge. However, its throw hitbox is active on frame 19, enabling it to throw opponents earlier than forward throw."
"227","Bowser","Up throw","","0.5% (hits 1-7),2% (hit 8),4% (hit 9)2% (throw)","Throws the opponent slightly upward, withdraws into his shell, and then spins rapidly in order to repeatedly stab them with his shell's spikes. He hops up on the final hit, launching the opponent upward. Can combo into forward or up aerial at low percents. Furthermore, the latter becomes a 50/50 KO setup at high percentages."
"228","Bowser","Down throw","","10% (hit 1),4% (throw)","Places the opponent on the ground and body slams them. Its high base knockback, low knockback scaling, and high ending lag prevent it from having any follow-ups. However, its very high damage and base knockback make it a good mixup and an option to send opponents offstage."
"229","Bowser","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swipes his claws behind himself and in front of himself while stumbling to his feet."
"230","Bowser","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swipes his claws around himself while getting up."
"231","Bowser","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swipes his claws around himself while getting up."
"232","Bowser","Edge attack","","10%","Bowser slowly climbs up from the ledge, then swipes at the ground in front of him. Has by far the longest range out of any edge attack."
"233","Bowser","Neutral special","Fire Breath","1.8%xN","Expels a stream of fire from his mouth. It gradually loses strength and range, but will slowly regain its strength when not in use. It can be angled upward or downward, which can potentially gimp recovering opponents, although the flames at the very end of the stream do not cause flinching. It deals notoriously high damage, as at close ranges it can potentially deal over 30% in a matter of a few seconds."
"234","Bowser","Side special","Flying Slam","18% (throw),15% (collateral)","Grabs an opponent, jumps with them into the air and backflips before belly-to-belly suplexing them onto the ground, causing an explosion effect. Bowser spins around dramatically during the descent. It deals immense vertical knockback that can KO at 120%, making it a very reliable KOing option. Its power and launching angle makes it difficult to properly DI, especially if the user has high gravity. The suplex can also hit other opponents on the ground that it lands into for similarly powerful knockback. It can be used to dive off-stage with the opponent for a potential sacrificial KO, although it is possible to recover if the opponent has a good vertical recovery. The ascent grants intangibility (frames 1-23), and can launch opponents significantly far when falling, although the explosion has no hitbox."
"235","Bowser","Up special","Whirling Fortress","1% (grounded hits 1-7),4% (grounded hit 8),7% (aerial hit 1),1% (aerial hits 2-11),2% (aerial hit 12)","Withdraws into his shell and spins around rapidly. It is capable of moving forward or backward while doing so, which makes it a very useful out of shield option. In the air, it propels Bowser diagonally upward, making it a very effective horizontal recovery but poor vertically. Button mashing at the end can slightly extend the vertical distance."
"236","Bowser","Down special","Bowser Bomb","4% (headbutt),20% (ground pound),11% (landing)","A Ground Pound. It deals immense vertical knockback to anyone hit and can KO under 100%, making it one of Bowser's most reliable KOing options. On the ground, Bowser performs a weak headbutt that drags opponents into the main attack, which is not possible to avoid if hit by it. If performed in the air, Bowser performs the Ground Pound after a brief pause instead of leaping first. Emits a shockwave upon landing and will break full shields if all of its grounded hitboxes connect. It will almost certainly cause a self-destruct if used off-stage due to its ending lag, though it can grab ledges if Bowser is near one. In midair, the startup can meteor smash."
"237","Bowser","Final Smash","Giga Bowser Punch","40%","Bowser transforms into Giga Bowser and teleports into the background, where he becomes impervious to attacks. Red crosshairs will appear on screen to indicate where Giga Bowser will aim his punch, which can be moved around with the control stick; the crosshairs also contains a depleting green gauge around their circumference to indicate how much time is left until the attack will activate automatically, though the attack can be activated manually before the gauge fully depletes. If the opponent's damage percent is 60% or greater before they are punched, they are instantaneously screen K.O.d."
"238","Yoshi","Neutral attack","","3%","A front kick followed by a roundhouse kick. The two hits transition relatively fast (both hits being frame 3) and can connect into a jab lock."
"239","Yoshi","Neutral attack","","4%","A front kick followed by a roundhouse kick. The two hits transition relatively fast (both hits being frame 3) and can connect into a jab lock."
"240","Yoshi","Forward tilt","","8%","Swings his tail in a forward direction. Due to the vertical launch angle, moderate base knockback, and drastically reduced ending lag, it can reliably start combos. It can follow into up smash, neutral and up aerial at low to mid percents."
"241","Yoshi","Forward tilt","","8%","Swings his tail in a forward direction. Due to the vertical launch angle, moderate base knockback, and drastically reduced ending lag, it can reliably start combos. It can follow into up smash, neutral and up aerial at low to mid percents."
"242","Yoshi","Forward tilt","","8%","Swings his tail in a forward direction. Due to the vertical launch angle, moderate base knockback, and drastically reduced ending lag, it can reliably start combos. It can follow into up smash, neutral and up aerial at low to mid percents."
"243","Yoshi","Up tilt","","7%","Brings his tail upwards, going from front to back. The front hitbox is now placed higher off the ground, making it unreliable in hitting grounded opponents. However, the back hit still hits close to the ground. Yoshi's most effective combo starter due low knockback growth and can even reach the low platforms of Battlefield, it leads into devastating combo strings at around low to mid percents and KO confirms at higher percents."
"244","Yoshi","Down tilt","","5% (base, 4.5% (mid), 4% (tip)","Lays on all fours and spins his body around to attack with his tail. The attack deals the least amount of damage out of all his tilts, but has the lowest ending lag out of all of Yoshi's tilts. It can be useful for tech chasing and stage control."
"245","Yoshi","Dash attack","","11% (early), 9% (late)","A far reaching side kick. Its long range and duration can create cross-ups, and is capable of punishing rolls or techs. However, its high amount of ending lag can make it very punishable."
"246","Yoshi","Forward smash","","15.5% (sweetspot), 14% (sourspot)","Rears his head back to perform a headbutt. The sweetspot takes priority over the sourspot and can be made into a fast KO option. It can also be angled and his head is intangible during the attack. It has a high amount of ending lag, however, and makes it punishable because of it. Yoshi's head becomes intangible, starting from frame 12. It comes out on frame 14."
"247","Yoshi","Up smash","","14% (clean), 12% (late)","Performs a bicycle kick. The attack has a clean hitbox and can be a potential KO option. It can hit opponents who are behind Yoshi, but has somewhat punishable ending lag."
"248","Yoshi","Down smash","","10% (tip), 12% (close)","Crouches and swings his tail forward, and then backwards. Compared to his other smash attacks, it lacks any real versatility outside of reading ledge rolls or instances where forward and up smash are punishable."
"249","Yoshi","Neutral aerial","","10% (clean), 7% (mid), 5% (late)","A flying sex kick ith very low startup (frame 3). Good power and one of Yoshi's most versatile moves. Its low landing lag allows it to lead reliably into follow ups at low to mid percents, depending on which hitbox connects. A potent out-of-shield option, as well as a combo breaker. Effective at setting up tech chases."
"250","Yoshi","Forward aerial","Noggin Dunk","15% (close), 14% (tip)","Rears his head back and then performs a downward headbutt. Possibly Yoshi's best edgeguarding tool, with both hitboxes dealing an impressive amount of damage, knockback, and the tip is a meteor smash. Although, it has decent startup lag (16 frames) and can no longer autocancel in a short hop."
"251","Yoshi","Back aerial","","3.5% (hits 1-2), 5.5% (hit 3)","Hits three times with his tail. A fast aerial, with its first hit coming out at frame 11, and has effective damage output and knockback. Grounded opponents receive low vertical knockback from the first two hits, making them effective at starting combos. Autocancels in a full hop."
"252","Yoshi","Up aerial","","12%","Flicks his tail upwards. Yoshi's fastest aerial attack, having frame 5 startup. Has a large vertical hitbox where the back can even hit grounded opponents, and due to being a very effective juggling option, it’s one of Yoshi’s most useful moves."
"253","Yoshi","Down aerial","Flutter Kick","2.3% (hits 1-6), 1.9% (hits 7-12), 2.8% (last hit)","Yoshi performs a series of downwards kicks that closely resembles his Flutter Jump. Notorious for being the most damaging aerial move in every iteration of the game, it deals 28% base damage if all the hits connect. Hits link reliably into each other and the final hit has high base knockback, making the move a powerful vertical KO option when near the top blast zone."
"254","Yoshi","Grab","","—","Opens his mouth and lets out his tongue to pull the opponent into his mouth. Compared to other fighters, Yoshi’s grabs have a lot more range, but an considerable amount of startup and ending lag."
"255","Yoshi","Pummel","","1.3%","Chews the opponent. A relatively fast pummel that doesn't deal too much damage."
"256","Yoshi","Forward throw","","9%","Spits the opponent forward. It has slight KO potential near edges and is mainly used for stage control."
"257","Yoshi","Back throw","","9%","Turns around and spits out the opponent. Otherwise, extremely similar to forward throw."
"258","Yoshi","Up throw","","5%","Spits the opponent upwards. The throw has significantly increased knockback, allowing it to KO at around 230% compared to 500% in previous games. Otherwise, it has limited utility outside of tech chase setups on high platforms."
"259","Yoshi","Down throw","","4%","Spits the opponent down to the ground. Its combo potential is improved due to its lower ending lag and Yoshi’s increased jump speed."
"260","Yoshi","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Spins around and swings his tail around himself before getting up."
"261","Yoshi","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Headbutts behind himself and then in front of himself before getting up."
"262","Yoshi","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Spins around and swings his tail around himself before getting up."
"263","Yoshi","Edge attack","","9%","Swings his tail inward while climbing up."
"264","Yoshi","Neutral special","Egg Lay","7%","Yoshi swallows the opponent and traps them in a Yoshi Egg. When the opponent is trapped, they can escape by button mashing. They stay trapped longer the more damage they have. Upon escaping, opponents gain brief intangibility."
"265","Yoshi","Side special","Egg Roll","10%-13.8%","Yoshi will encase himself in a large Yoshi Egg after a small hop then roll around the stage. Damage dealt is proportional to momentum. Can jump once during the move. The attack has limited usage due to its predictable movement, slow startup and end lag, and lack of armor or disjoints. Does not deal damage until it first touches the ground. Can stall at the ledge if the control stick is not held towards it, but does no damage when stationary. Can be cancelled earlier by hitting the special button. Can move through shields."
"266","Yoshi","Up special","Egg Throw","6%","Throws a Yoshi Egg that travels on a controllable, parabolic arc. When used in midair, the first three throws grant Yoshi significant vertical distance based on his current vertical momentum,  with the largest possible jump being nearly as high as his double jump. After three uses in midair, it no longer grants upward momentum, and Yoshi must land to recover this. A very effective projectile that can now bounce upon hitting the ground, which makes it a more versatile option."
"267","Yoshi","Down special","Yoshi Bomb","4% (hop), 15% (grounded Ground Pound), 12% (aerial Ground Pound), 4% (stars)","A Ground Pound that produces damaging stars upon landing. The attack deals a good amount of damage and has very little startup lag. It's been given more safety since it can now sweetspot ledges, now allowing it to act as a 2 frame punish option. Also can go through soft platforms if the player holds down or is close to the platform on startup. Has increased shield damage; the grounded version can break a full shield if it is not stale and all hits connect on shield."
"268","Yoshi","Final Smash","Stampede!","6% (hit one), 46% (hits from other Yoshis)","Yoshi rushes forward and attacks the opponent with a upwards headbutt. If the attack hits, it cuts to a cinematic cutscene that takes place in a rocky gorge. Suddenly, an stampede of multicolored Yoshis are seen rushing down the gorge, and they attack by trampling the opponent. It has a striking resemblance to the Super Smash Bros. Melee opening movie, where it has a similar stampede as well as the similar rocky environment."
"269","Donkey Kong","Neutral attack","","4%","A hook followed by an uppercut."

"274","Donkey Kong","Up tilt","","10% (hand), 9% (arm), 8% (elbow)","An overhead arcing swipe. It deals more damage and knockback if the target is hit near DK's shoulder."
"275","Donkey Kong","Down tilt","Slouch Slap","6%","A crouching swat. It has a chance to trip opponents."
"276","Donkey Kong","Dash attack","","12% (clean), 9% (late)","The Roll Attack, his signature attack from Donkey Kong Country. It deals less damage towards its end."
"277","Donkey Kong","Forward smash","","22% (hands), 21% (arms)","A lunging clap. It deals slightly less damage if it hits with Donkey Kong's arms."

"281","Donkey Kong","Forward aerial","","16% (clean), 15% (late, hands), 13% (late, arms)","A double axe handle. If sweetspotted, the opponent is meteor smashed. One of the strongest meteor smashes in the game, KOing at around 35%. It appears similar to his midair attack from Donkey Kong 64, which itself was inspired by this attack due to SSB debuting before Donkey Kong 64."
"282","Donkey Kong","Back aerial","","13% (clean), 8% (late)","A back kick."
"283","Donkey Kong","Up aerial","","13%","An upward headbutt."
"284","Donkey Kong","Down aerial","","16% (foot), 13% (leg)","A stomp. Its sweetspot is a strong meteor smash, while its sourspot, which is close to Donkey Kong's chest, deals diagonal knockback."
"285","Donkey Kong","Grab","","—","Reaches out."
"286","Donkey Kong","Pummel","","1.6%","A slap. A fairly fast pummel."
"287","Donkey Kong","Forward throw","Kong Karry","12% (forward, up), 13% (back), 11% (down)","Hauls the opponent on his shoulder, allowing him to move and jump around while still holding the opponent. Appears to be based off of when DK holds an item in Donkey Kong Country, such as a Steel Keg. This gives him access to forward, back, up, and down throws that are distinct from his normal grabs.
Forward: Launches foes away from DK at a high angle.
Back: Heaves the opponent backward using both hands, launching them at a slightly higher trajectory.
Up: Heaves the opponent upward.
Down: A bear hug.
When the opponent is too damaged to escape in time, all of these throws allow for easy stage spikes. Donkey Kong can simply walk off the edge, pull back and throw them against the underside. However, this carries significant risk, as the opponent can tech it and thus result in DK ending up too far below the edge to recover if his timing is off.
Kong Karry has its own unique Grab mash frame equation, that being 163 + Ceiling[3.2 * Opponent's %] - 18 * N (valid inputs) - n (time held before cargo + previous mash before cargo). For the time held and the previous mash, the Ultimate grab equation would have to be used, which is 89 + Ceiling[1.7 * Opponent's %] - floor[14.4 or 8 (Button or Directional mashing) * N (valid inputs)] holding frames."

"295","Donkey Kong","Neutral special","Giant Punch","10% (uncharged), 28% (tenth wind-up/fully charged grounded), 25% (tenth wind-up/fully charged aerial)","A wind-up punch which fully charges after ten wind-ups. When fully-charged, the punch deals excellent damage, grants super armor, and is overall faster than if used uncharged. Its charge can charge canceled and saved, and chosen when to be released after being fully charged. DK will lose his midair jump if he uses the attack in the air."
"296","Donkey Kong","Side special","Headbutt","10% (grounded/sweetspot aerial), 8% (sourspot aerial)","A headbutt. The move buries the opponent, who will remain submerged longer if the opponent has already dealt a fair amount of damage. The aerial version will meteor smash the opponent if they are hit by its sweetspot. The move has super armor from the startup until the hitbox appears. It has a deceptively large range and high shield damage, so full power shields will barely manage to avoid breaking against this move."
"297","Donkey Kong","Up special","Spinning Kong","5% (grounded hit 1), 1.4% (grounded hits 2-6), 4% (grounded hit 7), 5% (aerial hit 1), 1% (aerial hits 2-13), 2% (aerial hit 14)","Rapidly spins around, trapping opponents and damaging them with a series of discus clotheslines and spinning backfists before launching them. Good horizontal distance, but very little vertical distance."
"298","Donkey Kong","Down special","Hand Slap","14% (ground), 5% (midair hit 1), 6% (midair hit 2)","Slaps the ground to cause earth-shaking vibrations. When grounded, Donkey Kong can keep pounding by repeatedly pressing the special button. The attack gives him some protection from opponents while grounded and has good range, but is unable to KO until extreme percentages due to its very low knockback growth. In midair, Donkey Kong will perform two midair slaps, the second hit being a powerful meteor smash that combos from the first slap. Originates from Donkey Kong Country."
"299","Donkey Kong","Final Smash","Jungle Rush","12% (initial hit), 1.2% (rapid hits), 14% (final hit), 61.9% (maximum)","Punches forward. If the initial hit connects, Donkey Kong will then perform a long series of rapid punches. Has about same range as his forward smash, but extremely powerful, KOing Mario as low as 24% on Final Destination."
"300","Diddy Kong","Neutral attack","","2%","Diddy Kong does two alternating inward slaps, followed by an outward side kick. Holding the attack button will have Diddy Kong repeat the first hit. The first 2 hits can lock."
"301","Diddy Kong","Neutral attack","","1.5%","Diddy Kong does two alternating inward slaps, followed by an outward side kick. Holding the attack button will have Diddy Kong repeat the first hit. The first 2 hits can lock."

"304","Diddy Kong","Up tilt","","6%","Diddy Kong swats in the air above him with a slap in a similar fashion to an uppercut. Hits quite quickly and can combo into most of Diddy Kong's aerial attacks at low to mid percent ranges."
"305","Diddy Kong","Down tilt","Hand Clap","5.5%","Diddy Kong claps in front of himself while crouching. An extremely versatile combo starter, as it can combo into a variety of moves at nearly any percentage, including down tilt to up smash as a notorious KO confirm."
"306","Diddy Kong","Dash attack","","2% (hits 1 and 2), 3% (hit 3)","Diddy Kong performs his signature Cartwheel attack from Donkey Kong Country, concluding with a double-handed ground-slap. The final hit has largely vertical knockback and can combo into aerials at low to mid percent ranges."
"307","Diddy Kong","Forward smash","","5% (hit 1), 11%/9% (hit 2)","Diddy Kong jumps forward while spinning, and performs an open-handed slap followed by a spinning back fist with his opposite arm. The first hit combos into the second, which has good knockback and killing power. However, it is easily punished if missed. Often only used in combination with his banana peel."
"308","Diddy Kong","Up smash","","2.5% (hits 1 and 2), 6% (hit 3)","Diddy Kong leaps upward and performs a stationary cartwheel, attacking upwards with an open-handed slap, a reverse heel kick, and an uppercut."
"309","Diddy Kong","Down smash","","12% (hit 1), 15% (hit 2)","Diddy Kong performs a flare, kicking in front and then behind himself."
"310","Diddy Kong","Neutral aerial","","6%","Diddy Kong does an aerial cartwheel similar to his dash attack. Very high ending lag, so much so that Diddy Kong  should avoid using this move offstage. However, it deals a low amount of vertical knockback, which can lead to potential footstools or aerial follow ups (though due to changes regarding footstooling, it is no longer an always-guaranteed option), giving it usage as a combo extender."
"311","Diddy Kong","Forward aerial","Screw Kick","10% (clean), 8% (late)","Diddy Kong does a dropkick while spinning."
"312","Diddy Kong","Back aerial","","9%","Diddy Kong does a reverse spin kick behind himself."
"313","Diddy Kong","Up aerial","","7%","Diddy Kong performs an overhead kick in an arc. Tied for the fastest in the game (frame 4 startup) but the animation is faster with its duration unchanged, causing it to have a blindspot in front of Diddy."
"314","Diddy Kong","Down aerial","","13% (fists), 10% (arms)","Diddy Kong swings both arms downward in a double axe-handle punch. A strong meteor smash and Diddy Kong's strongest aerial overall, though it is also his slowest. It has a large auto-cancel window at the beginning of the attack before the hitbox starts, which makes it a good tool for landing provided that you input the move shortly before touching the ground. It can also jab lock opponents at low percent ranges."

"316","Diddy Kong","Pummel","","1%","A headbutt."
"317","Diddy Kong","Forward throw","","9%","Diddy Kong tosses his opponent forwards. The throw is based on Diddy Kong's barrel toss animation from Donkey Kong Country. Diddy Kong's second strongest throw, KOing middleweights around 156% at the edge of Final Destination."

"325","Diddy Kong","Neutral special","Peanut Popgun","4.8%-13.8% (peanuts), 3% (close range), 23% (explosion)","Diddy Kong shoots a peanut from his Popgun. A safe projectile attack that is rather useful in neutral. It can also be canceled in the air if the shield button is held before inputting the special button, which is useful for B-reversing to make Diddy Kong's movement harder to predict. The peanuts have the property of items, and can be caught and thrown. The peanuts also bounce off of opponents and solid surfaces, but they lose their hitbox afterwards.
The longer Diddy Kong charges the attack, the farther and quicker the peanut will fly. If Diddy Kong overcharges the attack, however, it will cause a very powerful explosion that leaves him vulnerable but possesses massive knockback."
"326","Diddy Kong","Side special","Monkey Flip","14% (clean midair kick), 12% (mid midair kick), 10% (late midair kick), 1% (grab loop), 3% (grab attack, hit 1), 7% (grab attack, hit 2), 3% (jump attack, hit 1), 8% (jump attack, hit 2)","Diddy Kong performs a back-flipping forward leap that has him cling onto an opponent. Inputting the move as a smash attack increases the distance of the jump. Once he has clung onto the opponent, he will continuously scratch them. During this time, he can perform an action depending on what button is pressed: pressing the attack or special move button will cause Diddy Kong to attack them with a double-handed chop them and then leap away, while pressing the jump button will cause him to perform a pseudo footstool jump, which can meteor smash at high percentages. If the attack or special button is pressed during the jump, Diddy Kong will attack with a flying kick instead of latching on to his opponent. However, if Diddy Kong chooses to use the flying kick he will not be able to use his rocketbarrel pack unless he touches the ground first, making it a risky option offstage."
"327","Diddy Kong","Up special","Rocketbarrel Boost","10% (launch explosion), 8% (early collision), 6% (late collision), 18% (collision explosion; detached Rocketbarrel Pack) 3.75%~4.33% (flying Rocketbarrel Pack); 5% (crash recoil)","Diddy Kong charges his rocketbarrel pack from Donkey Kong 64 in a powerful attack. Can potentially fly very far and very fast when charged, however hitting a surface, or being hit, will make Diddy Kong lose his rocketbarrels before falling a huge distance while being unable to perform any action, often falling too far to survive. Diddy Kong will also take recoil damage for hitting a surface."
"328","Diddy Kong","Down special","Banana Peel","3.8%~5.3%","Diddy Kong tosses a Banana Peel over his shoulder and into the air to have it fall onto the ground. Grounded opponents who touch the peel while on the ground or are hit by the peel when thrown will slip and trip on the floor. An integral part of Diddy Kong’s kit, as it allows him to take control of the stage, extend and create combos, set up kills, easily punish missed attacks from his opponents even if they are spaced properly, and otherwise dominate the neutral game. A held banana also serves as one of the best out of shield options in the game when thrown. Only one banana peel can exist at one time, and it disappears when hit by an opponent or when thrown twice."
"329","Diddy Kong","Final Smash","Hyper Rocketbarrel","0.5% (startup loop), 2.5% (per collision), 20% (final hit), 15% (collateral final hit), 10% (explosion)","Diddy Kong activates his Rocketbarrel Pack and flies up. He then dashes across the screen in multiple directions, dealing damage to whoever he touches. After a while, he will lock on to whatever opponent has taken the most damage, and unleash one final dash attack that launches the targeted opponent, as well as any other nearby opponents. After this last attack, Diddy Kong descends back to his original position. His Rocketbarrel Pack explodes before he lands, which damages nearby opponents."
"330","Zelda","Neutral attack","","2.5% (hits 1-2)","Emits a magic burst, follows up with a series of several magical bursts, and finishes with a final blast, which can KO near the edge at reasonable percentages."
"331","Zelda","Neutral attack","","0.2% (loop), 3% (end)","Emits a magic burst, follows up with a series of several magical bursts, and finishes with a final blast, which can KO near the edge at reasonable percentages."
"332","Zelda","Forward tilt","","12% (blade), 10% (arm)","A magically-infused, outward fanning knifehand strike, swinging a magically produced blade. It can be angled and its sweetspot, which is located on the magically produced blade, possesses respectable power. Its sweetspot KOs middleweights at around 93% while near the edge of Final Destination. Its sourspot, which is located at Zelda's arm, is also reliable for KOing in spite of it being noticeably weaker. Its sourspot KOs middleweights at around 109% while near the edge of Final Destination. It is safe on shield if spaced correctly. However, it has noticeable overall lag and a narrow hitbox."
"333","Zelda","Up tilt","","7.2%","Waves her arm in an overhead arcing motion while her hand is infused with magical energy. Due to it hitting on frame 7 and having minimal ending lag, it is a reliable combo starter. It can combo into itself, neutral attack, forward smash, Nayru's Love, and Farore's Wind at low percentages; into neutral aerial from low to medium percentages; and up aerial at medium percentages. It is also decent as an anti-air attack."
"334","Zelda","Down tilt","","5.5%","A kneeling shin kick. Due to it hitting on frame 5, it is Zelda's fastest tilt attack. However, unlike in SSB4, it has minimal combo potential, mostly serving as a fast safe poke."
"335","Zelda","Dash attack","","12% (clean sweetspot), 9% (clean sourspot), 6% (late)","A double palm thrust that emits a blast of magical energy from her hands, similarly to Peach's dash attack. Due to it hitting on frame 6, it is one of the fastest dash attacks in the game. To compliment this, its sweetspot's base is strong enough to KO middleweights at around 99% while near the edge of Final Destination. However, it has noticeable ending lag, while its other hitboxes lack KO potential."
"336","Zelda","Forward smash","","1% (hits 1-4), 13% (hit 5)","A palm thrust that emits a multiple-hitting blast of magical energy. Its last hit's respectable damage output and very high knockback growth make it strong enough to KO middleweights at around 65% while near the edge of Final Destination. Its multiple hits also make it useful for pressuring shields, especially when it is charged. With proper spacing, it is safe on shield. Due to it hitting on frame 16, however, it has the highest start-up lag out Zelda's smash attacks. It also has a moderate amount of ending lag, with 26 frames."
"337","Zelda","Up smash","","2% (hits 1-4), 0.8% (hits 5-6), 5% (hit 7)","Waves her arm twice in an overhead fanning motion while her hand is infused with magical energy. It hits on frame 9, which is fairly fast for a smash attack. When coupled with its multiple hits and its last hit's extremely high knockback growth, it is useful for both KOing and pressuring shields. Its last hit KOs aerial middleweights at around 104% from anywhere on Final Destination. However, it has minimal horizontal range, long duration and 30 frames  of ending lag, thus making it punishable if not used properly."
"338","Zelda","Down smash","","12% (front), 10% (back)","A spinning shin kick. Due to it hitting on frame 5, it is tied with Mario's, Dr. Mario's, Ryu's, and Ken's down smashes for the second fastest smash attack of any kind in the game, being surpassed only by Meta Knight's buffered down smash. It is also a semi-spike that hits on both sides, which make it very useful for punishing rolls or setting up an edge-guard. Although it is Zelda's weakest smash attack, it is still quite powerful, and has rather low ending lag. Its front hit KOs middleweights at around 117% while near the edge of Final Destination. In comparison, its back hit KOs them at around 122% while near the edge of Final Destination."
"339","Zelda","Neutral aerial","","2.5% (hits 1-4, front), 1.5% (hits 1-4, back), 5% (hit 5)","Spins with her arms outstretched and infused with magical energy. Due to it hitting on frame 6, it is tied with forward and back aerials for the lowest amount of start-up lag out of Zelda's aerials. It has a decent amount of utility: it can be used as a follow-up from down throw; as a combo starter when SHFF'd; or as an edge-guarding option. It can also autocancel in a short hop. However, at higher percents, opponents are liable to being launched out of the multi hit portion, reducing its consistency and reliability."
"340","Zelda","Forward aerial","Lightning Kick","20% (clean foot), 4% (clean leg, late)","A magically-infused flying kick. Its sweetspot is at the tip of her foot, and has both an outstanding damage output and high knockback growth. Its sweetspot KOs middleweights at around 59% while near the edge of Final Destination. Due to coming out on frame 6,it's extremely fast for its power. Compared to back air, it has a slightly smaller sweetspot and less  knockback, but autocancels slightly earlier and has less landing lag. The sweetspot is easier to land if it hits the opponent at the beginning of the move. However, its sourspots lack KO potential and are very unsafe because of their extremely low damage outputs and average knockback growth. Its considerable ending lag also makes it punishable at low percentages, even if it is sweetspotted. Autocancels in a full hop."
"341","Zelda","Back aerial","Lightning Kick","20% (clean foot), 4% (clean leg, late)","A magically-infused flying kick. It functions almost identically to forward aerial, with the only differences being that its sweetspot has slightly more base knockback and knockback growth. Its sweetspot KOs middleweights at around 54% while near the edge of Final Destination. However, it has the highest amount of landing lag out of Zelda's aerials."
"342","Zelda","Up aerial","","17%","Leans back and turns slightly to extend her arm in order to emit a magical explosion from her index and middle fingers. It is the most damaging up aerial in the game, and when coupled with its consistent hitbox, it is Zelda's most reliable aerial KOing option, KOing middleweights at around 100% from a full hop. It can also clip through the bottom of a stage's edge. However, it is slow, hitting on frame 14, which makes it tied with down aerial for the highest amount of start-up lag out of Zelda's aerials. It also has high ending lag (40 frames), a short duration, and fairly short horizontal range. It autocancels in a full hop when the move ends."
"343","Zelda","Down aerial","Meteor Heel","16% (clean), 5% (late, leg), 4% (late, foot)","A magically-infused stomp. All of its hitboxes are meteor smashes, with its sweetspot being the most powerful among them. Its sourspot, though significantly weaker, lasts deceptively long, allowing it to potentially gimp fighters with poor recoveries. It also has the lowest landing lag out of Zelda's aerials, which enables its sweetspot to start combos on grounded opponents quite reliably. Safe on shield with proper spacing. However, it hits on frame 14, which ties it with up aerial for the highest amount of start-up lag out of Zelda's aerials.It autocancels in a short hop, but the timing is strict."
"344","Zelda","Grab","","—","Restrains the opponent with magic. Zelda's grabs have long ranges, with her pivot grab being  the longest non-tether  pivot grab, but noticeable start-up lag."
"345","Zelda","Pummel","","1.3%","A blast of magical energy."
"346","Zelda","Forward throw","","10%","Magically spins the opponent in front of herself and then throws them away. It  also useful for setting up edge-guards thanks to its high base knockback, but lacks KO potential because of its low knockback growth, often not KOing until 200% without rage. However it puts the opponent in a dangerous position."
"347","Zelda","Back throw","","12%","Magically spins the opponent and turns around with them in tow before throwing them away. In addition to being good for setting up edgeguards, it is among the strongest throws in the game, KOing middleweights at around 105% while near the edge of Final Destination."
"348","Zelda","Up throw","","11%","Magically spins the opponent overhead and then throws them upward. It is one of the most damaging up throws in the game, and has both excellent KO potential and decent combo potential, the latter especially being apparent against heavyweights and fast-fallers. It can combo into neutral aerial at low percentages; up aerial at medium percentages; and Farore's Wind at high percentages. However, each of these combos are heavily dependent on the opponent's DI. It can KO middleweights at around 146% from anywhere on Final Destination, similarly to Incineroar's, but with combo potential. Overall one of the best up throws in the game."
"349","Zelda","Down throw","","1.5% (hits 1-4), 2% (throw)","Magically shoves the opponent underneath herself and then blasts them with fiery, magical energy from her hands. It launches up and behind Zelda, which allows it to combo into neutral aerial, up aerial and, if timed precisely, back aerial. Its neutral aerial combos are easily avoidable with DI, especially past low percentages. In comparison, its up aerial and back aerial combo at mid percentages are more consistent, especially with proper timing. Its up aerial combo also boasts the ability to KO any character at high percentages. However, this combo will lose its effectiveness if Zelda has too much rage."
"350","Zelda","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Kicks in front of herself and then behind herself."

"354","Zelda","Neutral special","Nayru's Love","2% (hits 1-3), 5% (hit 4, close), 4% (hit 4, tip) 1.25× (reflected projectiles)","Creates a crystalline barrier around herself. The barrier deals damage and reflects projectiles with 25% more power and speed than they originally had. It also grants intangibility on frames 4-13, making it good as a defensive option against combos. However, it has moderate start-up and considerable ending lag."
"355","Zelda","Side special","Din's Fire","7%-14% (sweetspot), 3.5%-7% (sourspot)","Launches a magical fireball. It can be aimed up or down, and releasing the button causes it to explode. The longer the button is held down, the farther the fireball will travel, and it will automatically detonate when it reaches its maximum distance. Its sweetspot, which is located in the inner part of the explosion, is quite powerful, especially when fully charged. Fully charged sweetspotted Din's Fire KOs middleweights at around 87% while near the edge of Final Destination. However, it is very predictable, and its sourspot is very weak regardless of its charge."
"356","Zelda","Up special","Farore's Wind","6% (hit 1), 10% (grounded hit 2 near), 7% (grounded hit 2 far), 12% (aerial hit 2 near), 8% (aerial hit 2 far)","Warps to a given direction.  It travels a long distance and can be angled in eight directions similarly to Fox's Fire Fox, but is much faster compared to it. It deals damage upon contact while disappearing and while reappearing, and grants intangibility on frames 21-39. When combined with a jump, its travel distance is greatly increased.  Its grounded disappearance has very high base knockback, very low knockback growth and launches at 91°, all of which enable it to combo easily into its reappearance when it is aimed upward. In comparison, its reappearance has a sweetspot near Zelda that has a decent damage output, high base knockback and high knockback growth, all of which make it very reliable at KOing, especially near the upper blast line. Its sweetspotted reappearance KOs middleweights at around 68% while near the upper blast line of Final Destination and in conjunction with the initial grounded hit, while the grounded reappearance can KO middleweights at around 71% from the edge of Final Destination. However, its reappearance has a sourspot that, although safe, lacks KO potential because of its lower damage output and average base knockback, and due to it incurring helplessness, it is highly punishable if whiffed. It can be edgecanceled, a trait it shares with Sheik's Vanish, Mewtwo's Teleport and Palutena's Warp."
"357","Zelda","Down special","Phantom Slash","4.7% (level 1), 6.6% (level 2), 8.5%/9.4% (level 3) 11.3%/12.2% (level 4), 14.1% (level 5)","Conjures a Phantom piece by piece and propels it forward with another button press. Serves as a projectile with varying attacks reaching various levels of damage and distance depending on charge. When fully charged, the phantom will delay its attack for around a second, giving Zelda time to add pressure, perform combinated combos or to retreat for protection. When fully charged, the phantom can KO middleweights at around 84% from the edge of Final Destination. Very versatile and one of Zelda's best options in the neutral game and advantage state."
"358","Zelda","Final Smash","Triforce of Wisdom","7% (initial vacuum), 3% (subsequent vacuum), 60% (main)","Uses the Triforce of Wisdom to generate a triangular portal that sucks in opponents using massive periodic shockwaves. Upon catching an opponent, they will either be launched with poor knockback. However, if they reach 100% or higher during it, they are instantly KO'd. Very difficult to avoid on smaller stages, due to its long length and large vacuum hitboxes."
"359","Ganondorf","Neutral attack","","11%","A palm thrust that discharges electricity upon landing. Ganondorf's fastest ground attack, with good range, knockback and fairly low ending lag, with enough power to KO around 145% near the edge and 195% from center. A decent out of shield option. However it is among the slower jabs in the game, coming out at frame 7, and its high hitbox placement allows some smaller characters to crouch under it."
"360","Ganondorf","Forward tilt","","14% (foot), 13% (leg)","A front kick. Good start-up on frame 10 with high semi-spike knockback, making it a powerful edgeguarding option against characters with minimal horizontal recoveries, while outright KOing around 140% from the center. However, its range is rather poor, with his neutral attack being able to outreach it, and can be crouched under by some smaller characters. Based on the kick used by himself and other large, sword-wielding enemies in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess."
"361","Ganondorf","Up tilt","Volcano Kick","24% (leg/explosion), 13% (explosion apex)","A delayed axe kick that produces an explosion. Has vacuum properties, a disjointed hitbox that can reach past ledges, and its clean hit is incredibly powerful, being infamous for instantly shattering full shields and its leg hitbox KOing as low as 45% when near the edge, making it one of Ganondorf's best edgeguarding options if used wisely. However, while it is the strongest up tilt in the game, it has immense starting lag at 60 frames, making it an extreme ""high risk, high reward"" move. The move has a late hitbox on the height of the explosion that is extremely weak, not KOing until 195% from the center of Final Destination."
"362","Ganondorf","Down tilt","Leg Sweep","14%","A crouching front kick. Good start-up on frame 10 and range, making it a decent out-of-shield. Also a reliable follow-up and tech-chase out of grounded Flame Choke. While it has powerful vertical knockback on the toe that can KO around 133%, it has more diagonal knockback on the thigh, making it Ganondorf's weakest and most inconsistent tilt attack overall."
"363","Ganondorf","Dash attack","","15% (clean), 11% (late)","A shoulder tackle. Good start-up on frame 10 and Ganondorf gains both a quick speed boost during the move's duration. The clean hit can combo into up aerial at early percentages, and is able to reliably KO around 120%. The late hit, while lacking any KO potential, has combo utility due to its long lasting hitbox and weak knockback that can combo into any of Ganondorf's aerials at varying percentages. Also a reliable follow-up and tech-chase out of grounded Flame Choke."
"364","Ganondorf","Forward smash","","24%","A lunging, two-handed downward sword slash. Humorously nicknamed as Doriyah by the community, based on his exclamation during the attack. The third strongest forward smash in the game, behind King Dedede's and Max Aura Lucario's, KOing at 65% from the center. Great reach that covers overhead and slightly behind him, and hits slightly underneath the stage, allowing it to hit ledgehangs. However, it is Ganondorf's slowest smash attack, coming out at frame 29 and has 39 frames of ending lag, making it highly punishable if not fully spaced. Deals more than half shield health uncharged and can nearly break them if fully charged. Due to an error in interpolating hitboxes, the move has a large blindspot above and in front of Ganondorf's head."
"365","Ganondorf","Up smash","","24% (sword), 21% (arm)","An overhead 180° arcing sword slash from front to back. Deceptively large vertical reach, reliably punishing airborne or rolling opponents, and hits slightly underneath the stage, allowing it to hit ledgehangs. Very powerful, with the sword hitbox KOing opponents around 85%. Deals more than half shield health uncharged and can nearly break them if fully charged. However, it is Ganondorf's second slowest smash attack, coming out at frame 20 and has 37 frames of ending lag, making it punishable."
"366","Ganondorf","Down smash","","5% (hit 1), 15% (hit 2)","Kneels and thrusts the sword hilt forward, then performs a reverse gripped thrust behind himself in a similar manner to Cloud's down smash. The first hit launches opponents into the second, and can stage spike with ease due to its angle, while the second hit is a semi-spike, making it useful for launching opponents with weak horizontal recoveries off-stage. It hits on frame 15, making it Ganondorf's fastest smash attack, but its 60 frames of ending lag makes it just as punishable. The second hit by itself KOs around 67% near the edge."
"367","Ganondorf","Neutral aerial","","7% (hit 1 clean), 5.25% (hit 1 late), 12% (hit 2 clean), 9% (hit 2 late)","A back kick followed by a roundhouse kick. The first hit's overall weak power allows it to combo into the second kick, which has higher damage and KO power. Both kicks act as sex kicks, and the late hits can cause opponents to trip. Has the farthest horizontal reach out of all of Ganondorf's aerials, allowing it to wall out approaches, but the second kick's high vertical hitbox has a tendency to whiff against smaller characters. The first kick has a hitbox on the toe that knocks opponents away and is useful for creating distance. Starts on frame 7, making it Ganondorf's fastest aerial attack and a decent out-of-shield move. The second kick by itself KOs around 133%. Notorious for its extremely high damage and quick startup."
"368","Ganondorf","Forward aerial","","18% (fist), 17% (arm)","An overhand. Good reach and is very powerful, with the sweetspot KOing middleweights at 104% from center-stage. Also has decent start-up and a wide hitbox that starts slightly behind Ganondorf's head. Has the latest autocancel window out of all of Ganondorf's aerials, only cancelling when used from a double jump. It also has above average startup lag, coming out on frame 14."
"369","Ganondorf","Back aerial","","18.5% (fist), 17% (arm)","A backfist. Despite it being even stronger than his forward aerial, it is rather fast, with moderate startup at frame 10, and low ending lag of 36 frames, alongside being able to autocancel from a short hop. All these factors make it rather useful to wall out approaches, and is safe on shield. Second strongest back aerial in the game, with the sweetspot KOing middleweights at 102% from center-stage and at 75% near the edge, and is very likely to take a stock at medium percents if used quickly after a ledge trump. However, it has short reach and small hitboxes, while its high vertical hitbox and low amount of active frames makes it difficult to land on most grounded opponents, particularly those that are crouching."
"370","Ganondorf","Up aerial","","13%/12% (clean), 12%/10% (mid), 8%/6% (late)","A bicycle kick. Covers a large arc above him that has good coverage and great power, with the clean hit KOing middleweights around 94% near the edge. It also starts on frame 8, making it Ganondorf's second fastest aerial attack, and can autocancel from a short hop. Deals more damage and knockback when it hits closer to his body. The last few frames of this attack is a sourspot that semi-spikes with extremely low horizontal knockback and high hitstun, which is deadly for edgeguarding, especially at the end. However, the move does not hit below Ganondorf, and can only hit opponents standing on the ground with the earliest hitbox."
"371","Ganondorf","Down aerial","","19% (legs), 17% (body)","A double foot stomp. It discharges electricity upon landing and is the most powerful meteor smash in the game if hit with the lower half of his body, with grounded opponents being KO'd under 115%, and can KO any character starting at around 15% offstage. There is a sourspot on his shoulder that hits horizontally with less damage, but is still stronger than his forward and back aerial at higher percentages, though not as effective as when hitting with the meteor smash hitbox off-stage. Ganondorf's slowest aerial move at frame 16. It does not meteor smash until 10%, although Ganondorf can follow this with a jab."
"372","Ganondorf","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his left hand. Despite Ganondorf's tall stature, its reach is among the shortest."
"373","Ganondorf","Pummel","","1.6%","A knee strike."
"374","Ganondorf","Forward throw","","5% (hit 1), 8% (throw)","Lifts the opponent and hits them with an uppercut. One of the highest damaging forward throws in the game, and tied with up throw for Ganondorf's highest damaging throws. KOs around 150% near the edge."
"375","Ganondorf","Back throw","","5% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Throws the opponent behind himself and hits them with a side kick. Decent knockback and can set up an edgeguard. Ganondorf's strongest throw, KOing around 145% near the ledge."
"376","Ganondorf","Up throw","","10% (hit 1), 3% (throw)","Lifts the opponent overhead and hits them with an upward palm strike. Tied with forward throw for Ganondorf's highest damaging throws. High base knockback and low knockback growth makes it unsuitable for follow-ups while preventing it from KOing until 240%."
"377","Ganondorf","Down throw","","7%","A one-handed body slam. An extremely useful combo starter, capable of setting up into dash attack, neutral aerial, forward aerial, reverse aerial rush back aerial, up aerial, or Wizard's Foot at 0% to medium percentages. Additionally, its back aerial combo becomes a KO setup at higher percentages."
"378","Ganondorf","Floor attack (front)","","7%","A legsweep performed from a flare, an acrobatic technique used in breakdancing and gymnastics."
"379","Ganondorf","Floor attack (back)","","7%","A somersault kick."
"380","Ganondorf","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Spins around to kick those who are near."
"381","Ganondorf","Edge attack","","10%","Performs a backfist while climbing up. Has a very long range and can even occasionally stage spike enemies near or at the edge behind him."
"382","Ganondorf","Neutral special","Warlock Punch","30% (ground), 37% (ground reverse), 38% (aerial), 40% (air reverse)","Winds up his left arm while charging dark magic for 70 frames and then performs a powerful, dark magic-infused backfist. Ganondorf can rotate 180° by turning in the opposite direction during the charging period to deal more knockback and damage, at the cost of 10 frames more startup. It also receives a significant damage and knockback bonus if used in the air or rotated 180°, with these bonuses being stackable. As a result, an aerial reverse Warlock Punch is powerful enough to one-hit KO any character at the ledge with enough rage and break any shield not at full size, while the grounded version can OHKO certain lightweight characters near the ledge. When reversed, it can KO middleweights at a mere 16% with no rage. The grounded version has armor until just before the punch, though the aerial version does not even if he lands."
"383","Ganondorf","Side special","Flame Choke","12% (ground throw), 15% (air throw), 4% (release)","Lunges forward with his hand extended out and infused with dark magic. Upon contact, he grabs the opponent's face and blasts them with a pulse of dark magic that drops them onto the ground. On the ground, the move has super armor as Ganondorf holds his opponent in the air, and its low ending lag allows follow-ups into neutral attack, forward tilt, down tilt, or dash attack, but the opponent can tech and enforce tech-chases. In the air, Ganondorf grabs onto and descends in order to chokeslam them to the ground, or to the lower blast line in a suicide KO if used off-stage, however opponents can escape by button mashing if their percentage is lower than Ganondorf's, and Ganondorf himself will always lose if he and his opponents are on their last stocks. Due to functioning as a grab, it bypasses shields and counterattacks, while it can also can be used for a short-ranged horizontal recovery option due to it grabbing edges. Moderately slow startup of 16 frames, and surprisingly poor reach as the grabbox does not even cover Ganondorf's hand."
"384","Ganondorf","Up special","Dark Dive","1.9% (hits 1-4), 9% (throw), 7% (uppercut), 6% (release)","Leaps upward and, upon coming into contact with an opponent, latches onto them and discharges electricity before launching off of them with a dark explosion. The throw is very powerful, KOing around 89% near the edge, making it somewhat risky to edgeguard should he land it while facing away from the stage. Should Ganondorf successfully lands a grab, he is not rendered helpless and can use it again. If the grab misses an opponent, Ganondorf will perform a dark magic-infused uppercut that deals weak knockback. Covers a very small amount of horizontal distance, but a decent amount of vertical making it a sub-par recovery. The move also has very high endlag of 50 frames after a successful grab, enough for a opponent that is thrown onto the stage to tech and punish Ganondorf. Decent startup at frame 14 making it a decent out-of-shield, but has a high grabbox placement that frequently whiffs smaller opponents on the ground."
"385","Ganondorf","Down special","Wizard's Foot","14% (ground leg), 16% (ground foot), 15%/14% (air, clean/late), 8% (landing)","A dark magic-infused flying kick. On the ground it has good damage that beats most weak projectiles and high knockback that KOs around 93% near the edge. In the air, Ganondorf flies diagonally downward and performs a powerful meteor smash during its start-up, while its late hit launches opponents vertically instead. A small shockwave is formed around Ganondorf when he lands on the ground, which deals a small amount of knockback. Deals relatively high shield damage in the air, bringing shields to a sliver of their health if all of its hitboxes connect. Slows down significantly on impact with anything, has moderately slow startup of 16 frames, moderate ending lag of 61 frames, very high landing lag of 45 frames, very small hitboxes, and is extremely risky to use off-stage."
"386","Ganondorf","Final Smash","Ganon, The Demon King","10% (greatswords), 45%/35% (charge)","Uses the Triforce of Power to transform into Ganon, his boar-like demonic form. Immediately upon transforming, Ganon performs downward slashes with his swords and then charges straight ahead."
"387","Sheik","Neutral attack","","2%","An inward knifehand strike, followed by an upward knifehand strike. When button mashed, Sheik performs a barrage of knifehand strikes, followed by a palm thrust.  Fast, at frame 2, and deals about 10% with good SDI. Can kill on certain platforms, such as one of the platforms on Town and City."
"388","Sheik","Neutral attack","","1.6%","An inward knifehand strike, followed by an upward knifehand strike. When button mashed, Sheik performs a barrage of knifehand strikes, followed by a palm thrust.  Fast, at frame 2, and deals about 10% with good SDI.

"389","Sheik","Neutral attack","","0.3% (loop), 2% (final)","An inward knifehand strike, followed by an upward knifehand strike. When button mashed, Sheik performs a barrage of knifehand strikes, followed by a palm thrust.  Fast, at frame 2, and deals about 10% with good SDI. Can kill on certain platforms, such as one of the platforms on Town and City."
"390","Sheik","Forward tilt","Cycle Kick","3%","An inwards roundhouse kick. Deals very poor damage, but can string into itself and its low vertical knockback grants it excellent combo potential."
"391","Sheik","Up tilt","","3% (hit 1), 4% (hit 2)","Performs a stretch kick that transitions to an axe kick. The first hit is hard to land on grounded opponents. Like forward tilt, its low damage is compensated by its great combo ability."
"392","Sheik","Down tilt","","4.5%","A legsweep. The tip has a hitbox that launches the opponent straight up, while the rest of the move launches at a non-optimal 45-degree angle. The sweetspot combos into forward tilt, up smash, and all aerials besides down air. The tip leads into up smash for a KO at around 90%, though the timing is very strict."
"393","Sheik","Dash attack","","7% (clean), 5% (late)","Lunges to perform an outward fanning knifehand strikes with both of her arms. While situational, its fast startup at frame 5 and decent base knockback make it a decent punishment tool."
"394","Sheik","Forward smash","","5% (hit 1), 8% (hit 2)","A roundhouse kick followed by a jumping spinning side kick. Both attacks cause Sheik to move forward. One of Sheik's best KOing moves, although its power compared to other forward smashes is weak. Crosses up shields if done close enough."
"395","Sheik","Up smash","Razor Wing","15% (hit 1), 11% (hit 2)","Raises her arms overhead and then quickly swings them downward to perform outward fanning knifehand strikes. There is a hitbox at Sheik's hands, just before she swings down her arms, that hit opponents above her. If close enough to a tall character, it is possible to land both hits of the move, but this is difficult to achieve. When sweetspotted, it is Shiek's strongest move overall and one of her best KOing options. However it has high ending lag and the second hit lacks KO potential."
"396","Sheik","Down smash","","4% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","A modified butterfly kick performed from the windmill (a breakdancing move). Does very poor damage and has below-average knockback for a smash attack, but it starts up quickly."
"397","Sheik","Neutral aerial","","6% (clean sweetspot), 5% (clean sourspot), 4% (late sweetspot), 3% (late sourspot)","A flying kick. Very fast at frame 3, and a great combo breaking or out of shield option. Great for edgeguarding due to its somewhat powerful sweetspot and sourspot that lingers for a long time. The late hitbox on landing combos into Bouncing Fish at around 100% for a KO confirm. Autocancels in a short hop, but with strict timing."
"398","Sheik","Forward aerial","Hatchet","4.5% (sweetspot), 3.8% (sourspot)","A lunging, downward knifehand strike. Its sweetspot is located on Sheik's arm, while the sourspot is on her body. Comes out on frame 5 with minimal ending lag. Low base knockback, but very high knockback scaling. Combos into itself and other moves exceptionally well, including Bouncing Fish which can lead into a KO. Safe on shield if properly spaced. Has a very generous autocancel window, being able to do so after 11 frames."
"399","Sheik","Back aerial","","9.5% (clean sweetspot), 7.5% (clean sourspot), 6% (late)","A high-angled back kick. While its power is slightly below-average for a back aerial, it can easily gimp characters with bad recoveries or outright KO offstage starting at around 90%. Hits on frame 4, sharing its speed with up aerial and making it one of the fastest moves of its kind in the game and autocancels in a short hop."
"400","Sheik","Up aerial","","1% (hits 1 - 3), 4% (hit 4)","A diagonal, corkscrew flying kick, concluded by another kick with the opposite leg. KOs reliably near the top blast zone, and can be set up into by forward tilt or down tilt, though this requires precise timing and doesn't KO until around 120%. Can be used after a forward tilt to drag the opponent down and lead into another forward tilt. Does not autocancel in a short hop."
"401","Sheik","Down aerial","","10% (descent), 2% (landing)","A diagonal flying kick. It is a stall-then-fall, and its clean hitbox is a meteor smash during its beginning. One of Sheik's least useful and most situational moves, as its lag makes it very punishable, and trying to use it offstage will most likely result in an instant self-destruct."
"402","Sheik","Grab","","—","Reaches out. One of the shortest grab ranges."
"403","Sheik","Pummel","","1%","A knee strike. Fast but weak."
"404","Sheik","Forward throw","","5% (hit), 2% (throw)","Performs the tie shan kao[1] (a technique used in Bajiquan), attacking with a shoulder bash. Combos into aerials and Bouncing Fish at starting percents. Can be comboed into Bouncing Fish at higher percents, though this is easily escapable with an airdodge. However, this can be conditioned and punished with Sheik's extremely fast movement and frame data."
"405","Sheik","Back throw","","5% (hit), 2% (throw)","Throws opponent behind herself and performs a mid-level side kick. The weakest back throw in terms of knockback. KO's Mario at roughly 565% at the edge of Final Destination."
"406","Sheik","Up throw","","3% (hit and throw)","A handstand kick. Sheik's least useful throw, as it does the least damage and cannot be comboed out of. It is also Sheik's strongest throw, but fail to KO middleweights until around 288% on Final Destination."
"407","Sheik","Down throw","","3% (hit and throw)","A collar drag takedown followed by a somersault axe kick. Can combo into up air at low percents."

"412","Sheik","Neutral special","Needle Storm","1.5% (per needle, close), 0.8% (per needle, far)","Accumulates up to six needles that can be thrown immediately or stored for later use. When used in the air, Sheik throws the needles downward at approximately 30°. One of Sheik's best options for camping and zoning. The needles have transcendent priority, and so cannot stop or be stopped by other attacks (including, for example, other projectiles)."
"413","Sheik","Side special","Burst Grenade","1% (grenade), 1% (vortex), 12.6% (explosion)","Throws a grenade attached to a tripwire. On detonation, it creates a small vortex that pulls opponents towards it, then explodes. The detonation can be delayed a second by holding the special move button. The grenade can be thrown a farther when used in the air or when thrown over an edge, and its explosion is strong enough to KO middleweights at 115% near the edge, making it useful for edge-guarding. If Sheik is attacked before the grenade explodes, the grenade will detach from the tripwire and become a non-explosive item that anyone can use."
"414","Sheik","Up special","Vanish","12% (disappearance), 5% (reappearance)","After a short delay, Sheik destroys a Deku Nut in order to disappear via a small explosion, before reappearing nearby in a controlled direction. Its disappearing hitbox's respectable damage output and very high knockback scaling enable it to KO at 100% while near the upper blast line. It also grants a small vertical boost when used in the air. Conversely, its reappearance hitbox deals much less damage, but also has a windbox that can push away opponents who are very close to wherever Sheik reappears. It grants intangibility on frames 19-53. Reappearing near a edge renders her helpless, though self-destructing with the move is difficult to do because it allows Sheik to grab the edge the moment she enters helplessness."
"415","Sheik","Down special","Bouncing Fish","11% (first kick), 13% (following kicks)","A 360° Tengkong Pantui Cepu[2] (a kick used in Nanquan). If it connects with an opponent, she will backflip a distance away and land on her feet. She can then kick up to three times by pressing the special move button again after the preceding kick connects. Upon missing, she experiences landing lag if she lands before the move's animation is over. It can also be executed earlier by pressing the special button again, and covers more distance if the control stick is held in whatever direction Sheik is facing. Its long horizontal travel distance, respectable damage output, and high knockback scaling make it one of Sheik's most viable KOing options. It KOs middleweights at 120% while near the edge, and grants intangibility on frames 3-4. Due to its earliest input hitting on frame 17 and its landing lag, however, it is punishable if it misses."
"416","Sheik","Final Smash","Sheikah Dance","3% (first hit), 2% (first hit, late), 50% (entire move)","Sheik dashes forward and slashes with her knife. If she catches anyone, the Sheikah eye symbol will appear onscreen, and the screen will darken. She will then proceed to launch an onslaught of attacks from multiple directions before finally launching the trapped opponent with a final slash. The last hit of her Final Smash launches opponents the opposite direction of the initial dash. Only one opponent can be trapped in her Final Smash, though anyone nearby will also take damage during the duration."

"431","Young Link","Back aerial","","5% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2)","Performs a double backwards kick. Functions similarly to his forward aerial, but trades range and power for less starting lag."
"432","Young Link","Up aerial","","15% (clean), 12% (late)","An upwards thrust. Has a deceptively long duration, and can KO at around 130% with the clean hit."
"433","Young Link","Down aerial","","18% (clean), 15% (late)","Performs the Down Thrust. Unlike Link's similar move, it does not meteor smash even with the clean hit. Deals enough knockback to KO at high percents, but is dangerous to use offstage due to its long duration and high endlag."

Has very quick startup. Just like the Spin Attack of the other two Link incarnations, it can be charged when grounded for more damage. Like Toon Link's it hits multiple times on the ground, with the final hit launching opponents. However while Toon Link's deals strong horizontal knockback, Young Link's deals weak vertical knockback, but with less ending lag it also has combo potential into aerials such as up air. The aerial version can carry opponents to the upper blast line, and KO them there at high enough percents."

"476","Toon Link","Neutral special","Hero's Bow","4% (uncharged), 12% (fully charged)","Equips his Hero's Bow to fire an arrow. It can be charged up for more power and range. The arrows move much slower than the arrows that Link or Young Link fire, making them easier to avoid. However, this also means that the arrows remain active for longer."
"477","Toon Link","Side special","Boomerang","8% (near), 9.6 (smash attack), 5% (far), 3% (return),","Throws his Boomerang forward. Spins vertically when thrown, then spins horizontally when returning. Can be aimed via directional input. Does more damage at the start and has additional range when inputted as a smash attack."
"478","Toon Link","Up special","Spin Attack","1% (uncharged hits 1-10), 3% (uncharged hit 11), 1.6% (charged hits 1-10), 4% (charged hit 11), 4% (aerial hit 1), 2% (aerial hits 2-4) 4% (aerial hit 5)","Spins with his sword outwards, slashing opponents nearby. The last hit launches opponents horizontally. The aerial version can carry opponents to the upper blast line, and KO them there if they're at a high enough percent."
"479","Toon Link","Down special","Bomb","5.4%-7%","Pulls out a Bomb."
"480","Toon Link","Final Smash","Triforce Slash","56.2%","Uses the Triforce of Courage to emit a thin beam of light from his left hand to stun an opponent in front of himself. If the beam comes in contact with an opponent, Link dashes forward and performs a barrage of slashes while they are trapped in a Triforce-shaped energy field before concluding with an outward slash that shatters the energy field and launches them and any bystanders."
"481","Link","Neutral attack","","3%","A downward slash, followed by an outward slash, then by an ascending slash. Has slow startup for a jab, but deals above-average damage, has good reach, and its third hit is a semi-spike with high base knockback, making it useful for tech-chasing and forcing opponents near edges offstage."
"482","Link","Neutral attack","","3%","A downward slash, followed by an outward slash, then by an ascending slash.

Has slow startup for a jab, but deals above-average damage, has good reach, and its third hit is a semi-spike with high base knockback, making it useful for tech-chasing and forcing opponents near edges offstage."
"484","Link","Forward tilt","","13%","A lunging downward slash. It has noticeably slow startup for a tilt attack, but deals high damage and knockback for one in return, while possessing long range, the ability to hit opponents above and slightly behind Link, and only average ending lag that makes it safe on shield if spaced properly. This attack resembles the Z-Targeting slash used by the Link from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time."
"485","Link","Up tilt","","11%","An overhead arcing slash, starting from behind. Has good juggling potential from low to mid percents, comboing into itself depending on the victim's weight and falling speed, and decent KO potential at high percentages for its start-up."
"486","Link","Down tilt","","9%","A kneeling inward slash. Has slow startup for a tilt, but low ending lag with vertical knockback, granting it combo potential into aerials and making it safe on shield with proper spacing."
"487","Link","Dash attack","Jump Slash","14% (tip), 13% (blade), 12% (body)","The Jump Attack. It is one of the strongest dash attacks in the game, KOing at around 110% from center stage when sweetspotted. However, it also has very slow startup (hitting on frame 20) alongside high ending lag, making it very punishable if whiffed or used recklessly."
"488","Link","Forward smash","Sword Slice","7% (blade), 14% (tip), 5%-13% (Sword Beam)","A two-handed, lunging downward slash. If the attack button is pressed again, Link will perform a single-handed outward slash. The first hit deals respectable damage and knockback at the blade's tip, but only deals half as much damage with much lower knockback when not tipped; however, the non-tipped hit is a natural combo into the second slash. Extremely powerful when both hits connect, being one of the strongest forward smashes in the game. If Link is at 0% damage, the first swing will launch a projectile."
"489","Link","Forward smash","Sword Slice","13% (blade), 12% (body)","A two-handed, lunging downward slash. If the attack button is pressed again, Link will perform a single-handed outward slash. The first hit deals respectable damage and knockback at the blade's tip, but only deals half as much damage with much lower knockback when not tipped; however, the non-tipped hit is a natural combo into the second slash.

"490","Link","Up smash","","4% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2), 11%/10%/9% (hit 3)","A series of three overhead arcing slashes, the last one which launches opponents away. Has average startup, covers a wide range, deals high damage and can KO under 100%, but has high ending lag. The third hit deals more damage the closer opponents are to the tip of the Master Sword."
"491","Link","Down smash","","17%/16%/14% (hit 1), 12%/11%/10% (hit 2)","A kneeling inward slash in front of himself, followed by a kneeling outward slash behind himself. The first hit launches opponents at a vertical trajectory, and can KO at around 100% uncharged with the strongest hitbox. The second hit is a semi-spike that has high base knockback, making it effective near edges, but deals less damage and overall knockback than the first hit."
"492","Link","Neutral aerial","","11% (clean, foot), 9% (clean, leg), 6% (late)","A flying kick. It is a sex kick with relatively low startup, ending and landing lag. One of Link's most useful moves overall, as it lets him escape pressure, is safe on shield with proper timing, and can even lock and combo into other moves on landing especially with the late hit, a notable followup being dash attack as a KO setup at high percents."
"493","Link","Forward aerial","","8% (hit 1), 10% (hit 2)","Two alternating, spinning outward slashes. The first hit has weak knockback in order to connect into the second hit, which deals high enough knockback to be one of Link's most reliable KO options. The move deals high damage if both hits connect, and due to its low landing lag and long range, it is also safe on shield move with proper spacing and timing. However, its slow startup, high ending lag and inability to autocancel before it can be interrupted leave it easy to punish if overused."
"494","Link","Back aerial","","5% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2)","A hook kick followed by a mid-level roundhouse kick. Link's fastest aerial, coming out on frame 5, and has low ending and landing lag, allowing it to combo into itself at low percents. The first hit can also set up various attacks on landing, including an up tilt, up smash, or most notably, a Spin Attack, the last two of which can serve as KO setups at high percents."
"495","Link","Up aerial","Jump Thrust","15% (clean), 13% (late)","The Up Thrust. It is quite powerful when clean and has a long lasting hitbox that is difficult to dodge, making it an effective KOing and juggling option. However, it has moderate startup, coming out on frame 11, can only autocancel in a full hop if done near the start, and leaves Link highly vulnerable from other positions due to its long duration."
"496","Link","Down aerial","Downward Thrust","18% (clean), 15% (late), 11% (bounce)","The Down Thrust. Upon hitting a target without fast falling, Link bounces off them and can then hit them a second time, albeit dealing less damage. The clean hit is a powerful meteor smash against aerial targets, while also dealing high knockback to grounded targets, KOing them at around 125%. Like up aerial, the move has very long lasting hitboxes, which along with its disjointed range make it useful for contesting attacks from below and intercepting recoveries offstage. However, due to its very long duration, high landing lag and inability to autocancel even in a full hop, it is Link's most committal aerial."
"497","Link","Grab","","—","Reaches out with one hand. A relatively fast grab, but possesses merely average range."
"498","Link","Pummel","","1.3%","Hits the opponent with the Master Sword's pommel. A fairly fast pummel."
"499","Link","Forward throw","","3% (hit 1), 2.5% (throw)","A front kick. Has little utility beyond launching opponents offstage, due to its weak power. Resembles the way Link punts objects in Breath of the Wild."
"500","Link","Back throw","","3% (hit 1), 2.5% (throw)","A back kick. Launches the victim facing away from Link and at a slightly higher angle, but it is otherwise identical to forward throw."
"501","Link","Up throw","","5% (hit 1, blade), 4% (hit 1, tip), 2% (throw)","Raises the opponent overhead and slashes them upward. Has relatively high knockback growth, which allows it to KO around 170% without rage. Against bystanders, it is a weak semi-spike with a sourspot at the base of the Master Sword; the thrown opponent is always hit by the sweetspot."
"502","Link","Down throw","","3% (hit 1), 3% (throw)","Pins the opponent to the ground and then performs an elbow drop. A reliable combo starter into his up tilt, up smash, neutral aerial and up aerial."

"507","Link","Neutral special","Bow and Arrows","4% (uncharged), 12% (fully charged), 6% (uncharged, two arrows), 18% (fully charged, two arrows), 2.1%-3.9% (thrown arrow)","Wields the Traveler's Bow and fires an arrow forward. Charging increases the arrow's speed, distance and damage output; at full charge, the arrow flies almost completely straight and covers a very long distance. Good for gimping recoveries and pressuring opponents from afar. Upon hitting the ground or a wall, the arrows also linger for a while before disappearing, during which they can be picked up and thrown as items. If Link uses this move with an arrow picked up, he will fire two arrows at once, greatly increasing the damage dealt to opponents."
"508","Link","Side special","Boomerang","8% (clean), 6% (late), 9.6% (clean, smash thrown), 7.2% (late, smash thrown), 3% (return)","Throws a Boomerang, which flies forward and then returns to Link. On the way forward, it launches enemies vertically with high base knockback, and on the way back, it launches them towards Link with weaker knockback, allowing it to set up combos. It can be angled up or down, and inputting it like a smash attack increases its damage, as well as the distance it can travel."
"509","Link","Up special","Spin Attack","14%/12%/9%/7% (grounded, blade), 11.2%/9.6%/7.2%/5.6% (grounded, tip), 4% (aerial hit 1), 2% (aerial hits 2-4), 4% (aerial hit 5)","A spinning, outward slash. Much like in the The Legend of Zelda series, it is a powerful attack, and can be charged on the ground for even higher damage and knockback. Conversely, an aerial Spin Attack is a series of spinning, inward slashes and is Link's primary recovery move, covering respectable vertical distance, but minimal horizontal distance. The grounded version is a fast out of shield option and decays on damage over time, KOing at around 120% uncharged with the strongest hit, while the aerial version deals up to 5 hits and can KO reliably near edges."
"510","Link","Down special","Remote Bomb","1% (throw), 7% (detonation)","Pulls out a Remote Bomb, which can be thrown as an item. After throwing it, using the move again has Link detonate the Remote Bomb with his Sheikah Slate, creating a large blue explosion. The Remote Bomb has a maximum duration of about 30 seconds before detonating automatically, and can be knocked back by attacks, which also causes it to damage opponents in range. The Remote Bomb's throw deals low damage and knockback, but its explosion is significantly more powerful, having enough knockback to KO at around 180% from center stage with no rage. The explosion hurts Link as well if he is in range, which has its pros and cons; while being detrimental to him if he detonates the Remote Bomb with opponents too close to him, it also gives him a useful bomb recovery, especially at high percents."
"511","Link","Final Smash","Ancient Bow and Arrow","35%","Wields the Ancient Bow and fires an Ancient Arrow straight forward, which explodes upon impact with the nearest opponent in its line of fire. It deals low damage compared to other Final Smashes, but has high KO potential."
"512","Dark Samus","Neutral attack","Straight and Cannon Hammer","3%","A left-handed jab followed by a forearm club with the Arm Cannon. Despite dealing above-average damage for a neutral attack, it is poor overall, as opponents can usually act out before the second hit connects by shielding or using a fast attack, while the second hit may not even connect at high percentages. Depending on the opponent's weight, it is safe and a true combo at high percents, but only if the first hit connects relatively close to the arm and not at the fist. The second hit does have KO potential at very high percentages, however."

The second hit does have KO potential at very high percentages, however."
"514","Dark Samus","Forward tilt","","11% (foot), 10% (leg), 9% (body)","A reverse roundhouse kick. Deals more damage and knockback at her foot, while her leg deals less damage and knockback. Can be angled, which causes it to deal more damage, but may cause it to miss shorter characters on the ground if angled up. The foot sweetspot deals rather potent knockback for a tilt attack, which can KO at the edge at around 125%. At varying percentages, depending on which part of the move is landed, it can lead into a guaranteed Charge Shot, as regardless of teching, Charge Shot can catch the opponent's option in time if they are knocked down."
"515","Dark Samus","Forward tilt","","10% (foot), 9% (leg), 8% (body)","A reverse roundhouse kick. Deals more damage and knockback at her foot, while her leg deals less damage and knockback.

"517","Dark Samus","Up tilt","","13% (grounded), 12% (aerial)","An axe kick resembling Captain Falcon's up tilt. It behaves unusually as it meteor smashes grounded opponents, but launches aerial opponents at a horizontal angle. This allows it to set up combos against the former at a wide range of percents, while still being a reliable edgeguard tool, due to its wide coverage and powerful enough knockback to KO aerial opponents at around 95% at the edge. At high percents, the grounded meteor can also set up KO confirms into a fully charged Charge Shot. However, the move has noticeable startup, due to coming out on frame 15, making it Dark Samus's slowest normal attack on the ground."
"518","Dark Samus","Down tilt","","12%","Kneels and quickly thrusts her Arm Cannon downward to fire a small, electric blast. It is very fast, due to coming out on frame 6, and deals respectable damage and knockback for a tilt attack, KOing at around 160% off the top blast line. It is useful as a close range anti-pressure option on opponents in front of Dark Samus, or as a punishment option. However, its very high ending lag leaves it easy to punish if shielded of missed."
"519","Dark Samus","Dash attack","","7% (early), 10% (clean), 6% (late)","A shoulder tackle with a white aura around Dark Samus. Deals more damage and knockback near the middle of the attack, KOing opponents at around 150% from the center of Final Destination, and earlier near edges. However, the early and late hits are noticeably weaker, and the move lacks combo potential."
"520","Dark Samus","Forward smash","","13% (Arm Cannon), 15% (blast)","Quickly thrusts her Arm Cannon forward to fire a small, electric blast. Functions similarly to Mario's forward smash, with the blast being the most powerful part of the move. It is one of the fastest forward smashes in the game, coming out on frame 10, while the blast has enough knockback to KO at around 100% from center stage. However, it is rather weak otherwise, with the Arm Cannon KOing at around 135%. It can be angled like her forward tilt, with the upward angle dealing more damage and knockback, though it can typically miss as a result; conversely, the downward angle can hit ledge hanging opponents, but deals slightly less damage and knockback. Compared to Samus' version of the move, it has slightly less range."
"521","Dark Samus","Forward smash","","12% (Arm Cannon), 14% (blast)","Quickly thrusts her Arm Cannon forward to fire a small, electric blast. Functions similarly to Mario's forward smash, with the blast being the most powerful part of the move. It is one of the fastest forward smashes in the game, coming out on frame 10, while the blast has enough knockback to KO at around 100% from center stage. However, it is rather weak otherwise, with the Arm Cannon KOing at around 135%. It can be angled like her forward tilt, with the upward angle dealing more damage and knockback, though it can typically miss as a result; conversely, the downward angle can hit ledge hanging opponents, but deals slightly less damage and knockback. Compared to Samus' version of the move, it has slightly less range."
"522","Dark Samus","Forward smash","","11% (Arm Cannon), 13.5% (blast)","Quickly thrusts her Arm Cannon forward to fire a small, electric blast.

Compared to Samus' version of the move, it has slightly less range."
"523","Dark Samus","Up smash","","3% (hits 1-4), 6% (hit 5)","Fires five electric blasts in an overhead arcing motion. This move works best as an anti-air attack, as its multiple hits give a good amount of aerial protection. Conversely, it is unable to hit grounded opponents unless they are close enough to Dark Samus. Compared to Samus's version of the move, however, Dark Samus can catch opponents at a lower height. It is also her most damaging smash attack, dealing 18% total uncharged. However, due to its hits being spread above Dark Samus, it can fail to fully connect if the opponent is hit from too far."
"524","Dark Samus","Down smash","","10% (front), 12% (back)","A legsweep. A semi-spike with decent speed and high base knockback, allowing it to set up edgeguards and punish rolls effectively. However, it is relatively weak from center stage, with the front hit not KOing until around 200%."
"525","Dark Samus","Neutral aerial","","10% (hit 1), 9% (hit 2, clean), 8% (hit 2, late)","A spinning roundhouse kick. Hits on both sides quickly and can autocancel with a short hopped fast fall. Its first hit also deals powerful knockback, which makes it a viable KOing option offstage or near the edge, as well as a decent combo finisher."
"526","Dark Samus","Forward aerial","","3% (hit 1), 1.6% (hits 2-4), 5% (hit 5)","Fires five electric blasts in a slow, downward arcing motion. The first four hits drag opponents into the rest of the move using the autolink angle, with the last hit carrying the entire attack's knockback. Dark Samus' main aerial move for both combos and protection. Extremely useful as an edge get-up option or against air dodges due to its multiple hits, and using the move immediately after a short hop can hit opponents with the last hit before Dark Samus lands again."
"527","Dark Samus","Back aerial","","14% (clean foot), 12% (clean leg), 9% (late)","A back kick. It is fast and deals powerful knockback when sweetspotted, which makes it an excellent KOing option, especially when edgeguarding. When sweetspotted, it is among the strongest back aerials in the game, KOing at around 110% from center stage."
"528","Dark Samus","Up aerial","","3% (hit 1), 1.3% (hits 2-5), 4% (hit 5)","A diagonal corkscrew flying kick, hitting multiple times. It is her fastest aerial, due to coming out on frame 5. Grounded opponents can be hit by the last hitbox if Dark Samus lands while starting the move in the air, although it is difficult to do so, and risky due to the move's high landing lag. It can be used as a follow-up after a dash attack, grounded up tilt, down aerial, or down throw, all of which can be followed up with another up aerial and/or can be finished off with a Screw Attack. On stages with platforms, it even has potential for a zero-to-death when using a platform to extend the combo."
"529","Dark Samus","Down aerial","","10% (early, late), 14% (clean)","Swings her Arm Cannon in a downward arcing motion. Hitting with the move's trail meteor smashes opponents, while the edges of the move at the very start and end deal decent horizontal knockback. Autocancels from a short hop, and due to its relatively low ending lag, the meteor smash is excellent for starting combos on grounded opponents, much like her up tilt."
"530","Dark Samus","Grab aerial","Grapple Beam","1.5% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2)","Fires the Grapple Beam. A useful spacing option due to having only 8 frames of landing lag. It autocancels from a full hop and has impressive range, being the longest grab aerial in game. In addition to its recovery and spacing capabilities, it is good at setting up combos at close range upon landing, due to its low landing lag. Unlike in previous games, however, hitting an opponent causes the Grapple Beam to retract earlier, while not reducing the move's ending lag."
"531","Dark Samus","Grab","Grapple Beam","—","Fires the Grapple Beam. It has impressive range and is tied with Samus's grab as the longest tether grab in the game. However, it is one of the slowest grabs in terms of ending lag, making it very punishable if missed."
"532","Dark Samus","Pummel","","1.3%","A palm strike. Has moderate damage and speed relative to other pummels."
"533","Dark Samus","Forward throw","","10%","Twirls the opponent overhead then flings them forward. Although its knockback has been increased, it remains too weak for KOing at realistic percents, unless Dark Samus has rage and is at the edge of the stage."
"534","Dark Samus","Back throw","","10%","Swings the opponent behind herself. Slightly more effective for KOing and setting up edgeguards than her forward throw, due to its lower launch angle."
"535","Dark Samus","Up throw","","5% (hit 1), 7% (throw)","Puts the opponent above herself and blasts them upward with her Arm Cannon. Dark Samus's most damaging and strongest throw, possessing enough knockback to KO middleweights under 190% from ground level and without rage. At low percents, it can also combo into an up aerial against large characters, as well as Screw Attack against most characters, though the latter will only connect its hits reliably on a few characters."
"536","Dark Samus","Down throw","","8%","Swings the opponent high above her head, then slams them onto the ground. A reliable combo starter, with its followups including a dash attack or dashing up smash at low percents, a neutral, back or up aerial up to mid percents, and a forward aerial up to high percents."
"537","Dark Samus","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings her Arm Cannon in front of herself and then fires a blast behind herself."
"538","Dark Samus","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Performs a low-level roundhouse kick."
"539","Dark Samus","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Performs a shin kick in front of herself and then a back kick behind herself."
"540","Dark Samus","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a legsweep while climbing up."
"541","Dark Samus","Neutral special","Charge Shot","5% (uncharged), 28% (fully charged)","Charges a ball of energy and fires it. Boasts excellent KO potential when fully charged, and is a useful intercepting move at a low charge. KOs at 70%-110% depending on rage and the opponent's weight and DI. Can be used to break shields if used in conjunction with her neutral attack, up or down tilts, aerials, Bomb and Super Missile. When using her forward tilt to launch the opponent into tumbling, it can set up a guaranteed combo into Charge Shot regardless of the opponent's tech option, as Charge Shot will always catch their tech direction."
"542","Dark Samus","Side special","Missile","8% (Homing), 12% (Super)","Fires a Missile, which homes in on the opponent. If the special button is tapped like a smash attack, Dark Samus will instead fire a Super Missile, which stays in place for a short while before traveling in a straight line, and deals more damage and knockback. Both variations deal low knockback, but can be used to break a shield if used in conjunction with a fully charged Charge Shot. Both Missile variations can also be used as set-ups by opening up an opportunity for a grab aerial, or Charge Shot, while the Super variation sets up better for a true combo into a forward jumping Charge Shot at high percentages. The Homing variation is also useful for catching recoveries and forcing air dodges, which can open up punishment opportunities."
"543","Dark Samus","Up special","Screw Attack","3% (grounded hit 1), 1% (grounded hits 2-8), 2% (grounded hit 9), 1% (aerial hits 1-12)","Leaps upward to perform a high-speed somersault while discharging energy. Shoots upward if initiated from the ground, while it gains distance slower if started in the air. A useful out of shield option, due to coming out on frame 4 on the ground, and deals good knockback that can KO around 100% while near the upper blast line."
"544","Dark Samus","Down special","Bomb","4% (contact), 5% (explosion)","Rolls into a Morph Ball and drops a Bomb, which explodes after a set time. Useful to force an opponent to shield and for edgeguarding, being capable of 2 frame punishes if timed correctly. It can also break shields depending on their health if used along with her up and down tilts or a fully charged Charge Shot."
"545","Dark Samus","Final Smash","Phazon Laser","0.5% (fringe loop), 1.5% (main loop), 2.5% (fringe blast), 5.5% (main blast)","Fires a very large, bluish white energy beam. The beam can be angled vertically during the Final Smash."
"546","Zero Suit Samus","Neutral attack","","1.5%","A knifehand strike, followed by a pistol-whip with her Paralyzer, followed by a 12-6 elbow. Is tied with Little Mac for the fastest jab, coming out instantly on frame 1. The first hit can lock, but the height of the hitbox causes it to miss small or crouching opponents on non-slanted terrain. It also has a terrible damage output, only dealing a total of 6% if all three hits connect."

The first hit can lock, but the height of the hitbox causes it to miss small or crouching opponents on non-slanted terrain. It also has a terrible damage output, only dealing a total of 6% if all three hits connect."
"549","Zero Suit Samus","Forward tilt","","8% (leg), 6.5% (body)","A roundhouse kick. Can be angled. The down-angled version may cause tripping at low percentages."

"552","Zero Suit Samus","Up tilt","","5% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2)","A butterfly kick-styled scissor kick performed from a variation of the 2000, a breakdancing move. It hits on frame 3, making it Zero Suit Samus' fastest tilt attack. It is also one of only two moves that hits in front of and behind her, with the other being neutral aerial, making it a good replacement to her down smash to hit both sides."
"553","Zero Suit Samus","Down tilt","","8% (leg), 6% (foot)","A legsweep. This lowers her hurtbox moreso than her crouch, allowing her to duck under most projectiles with proper timing. This move is great for setting up combos."
"554","Zero Suit Samus","Dash attack","","8% (clean), 5% (late)","Activates her Jet Boots to perform a jet-propelled knee strike."
"555","Zero Suit Samus","Forward smash","","5% (hit 1), 11% (hit 2)","A mid-level side kick, followed by a spinning side kick at a slightly higher angle. Due to it activating her Jet Boots, the second hit has a visible sweetspot in the form of a small, fiery blast at the tip of her foot. Unlike typical sweetspots, it has the same damage output as the sourspot; the only change is that it has slightly higher knockback scaling. Her side smash can be angled, but only the second kick changes in angle."

"557","Zero Suit Samus","Down smash","Slant Paralyzer","8% (near), 6% (far)","Aims her Paralyzer downward in front of herself and fires a paralyzing energy blast at the ground. This move has poor KO potential, instead being used to initiate combos. Opponents are paralyzed much longer at higher percentages."
"558","Zero Suit Samus","Neutral aerial","","8%","Spins in midair, swinging her Plasma Whip laterally around herself. Has low ending lag, allowing for combo opportunities if used from a short-hopped fast fall. It does not autocancel in a short hop."

"560","Zero Suit Samus","Back aerial","","12% (foot), 10% (leg)","A spinning hook kick behind herself."
"561","Zero Suit Samus","Up aerial","","6.5%","A bicycle kick. Thanks to its minimal start-up and ending lag, very low base knockback and very high knockback scaling, and low landing lag, it boasts excellent juggling potential."
"562","Zero Suit Samus","Down aerial","Slash Dive","6%, 5.5% (landing)","A diagonal flying kick, similar to Sonic and Sheik's down aerials. The hitbox at the beginning can meteor smash. Has the slowest startup lag of all of her aerials. Due to this move being a stall-then-fall, it is extremely risky to use off-stage, so it is rarely used as a meteor smash as most of times it can lead to a self-destruct. Even when she lands on the ground, there is high landing lag, making it easy to punish. Despite this, its extremely fast descent speed can enable it to counter a juggle if there is sufficient distance between Zero Suit Samus and the opponent."
"563","Zero Suit Samus","Grab aerial","Plasma Whip","5%","Lashes in front of her with the Plasma Whip."
"564","Zero Suit Samus","Grab","Plasma Whip","—","Performs a kneeling lunge to unfurl the Plasma Whip. A hitbox appears at her hand, allowing her to grab opponents with less lag."

"574","Zero Suit Samus","Neutral special","Paralyzer","4~6%","Assumes a kneeling position to fire a paralyzing energy blast from her weapon. It can be charged, which increases its damage output the duration of its paralysis, but at the cost of lowered speed. Targets hit by paralysis cannot be paralyzed again until making contact with the stage."
"575","Zero Suit Samus","Side special","Plasma Whip","2% (arm), 3.2% (whip, base), 1.2% (whip, middle), 4% (whip, held tip), 8% (whip, pressed tip)","Performs a kneeling lunge to unleash the Plasma Whip forward in a swirling motion. The whip hits repeatedly, while its sweetspot, which is located at the whip's tip, launches opponents away, and can KO at high percentages. Alternatively, holding down the special move button will have the tip of the whip snap upwards, knocking opponents up and towards her. While the held version deals less damage, it gives Zero Suit Samus an opportunity for followups."
"576","Zero Suit Samus","Up special","Boost Kick","5% (hit 1), 1.2% (hits 2 - 6), 4% (hit 7)","Activates her Jet Boots to perform a jet-propelled diagonal split-legged flying kick, followed by a spinning hook kick. One of her best KO moves against a midair opponent. It can also be angled forward or backward, which allows it to catch an opponent's air dodge, rolls and edge get-up reactions."
"577","Zero Suit Samus","Down special","Flip Jump","8% (stomp), 14% (kick)","A 720° Ce Kong Fan[2], a jumping technique used in contemporary Wushu. It functions as a third jump and grants intangibility on frames 3-12. It can deal damage in two ways: upon contact at the end of the jump, or by pressing either the attack button or special button during the jump. Upon contact, Zero Suit Samus performs a footstool stomp, which buries grounded opponents and meteor smashes aerial opponents. Pressing the attack or special buttons makes her perform a diagonal flying kick, which is very powerful. The flying kick also has a sweetspot at her foot that can meteor smash aerial opponents, but has slightly less knockback against aerial opponents."
"578","Zero Suit Samus","Final Smash","Zero Laser","1.2/1.6% (laser loop), 20/25% (final burst)","Zero Suit Samus leaps up, rising into the air, then appears atop her Gunship in the background, wearing her Power Suit. A player-controlled crosshair then appears, and after a short amount of time (or when the attack button is pressed), the now-suited Samus begins firing her Zero Laser with an area roughly equal to that of the crosshair. Like the version used by her suited counterpart, it hits multiple times. Opponents take more damage closer towards the center of the crosshair. At the end of the move, there is a brief pause, then one final burst is fired with enough power to launch opponents. Once the move concludes, Samus reverts to her Zero Suit and returns to her previous position."
"579","Samus","Neutral attack","Straight and Cannon Hammer","3%","A left-handed jab followed by a forearm club with the Arm Cannon. Despite dealing above-average damage for a neutral attack, it is poor overall, as opponents can usually act out before the second hit connects by shielding or using a fast attack, while the second hit may not even connect at high percentages. Depending on the opponent's weight, it is safe and a true combo at high percents, but only if the first hit connects relatively close to the arm and not at the fist. The second hit does have KO potential at very high percentages, however."

Can be angled, which causes it to deal more damage, but may cause it to miss shorter characters on the ground if angled up. The foot sweetspot deals rather potent knockback for a tilt attack, which can KO at the edge at around 125%. At varying percentages, depending on which part of the move is landed, it can lead into a guaranteed Charge Shot, as regardless of teching, Charge Shot can catch the opponent's option in time if they are knocked down."

"584","Samus","Up tilt","","13% (grounded), 12% (aerial)","An axe kick, which is identical to Captain Falcon's up tilt. It behaves unusually as it meteor smashes grounded opponents, but launches aerial opponents at a horizontal angle. This allows it to set up combos against the former at a wide range of percents, while still being a reliable edgeguard tool, due to its wide coverage and powerful enough knockback to KO aerial opponents at around 95% at the edge. At high percents, the grounded meteor can also set up KO confirms into a fully charged Charge Shot. However, the move has noticeable startup, due to coming out on frame 15, making it Samus's slowest normal attack on the ground."
"585","Samus","Down tilt","","12%","Kneels and quickly thrusts her Arm Cannon downward to fire a small, fiery blast. It is very fast, due to coming out on frame 6, and deals respectable damage and knockback for a tilt attack, KOing at around 160% off the top blast line. It is useful as a close range anti-pressure option on opponents in front of Samus, or as a punishment option. However, its very high ending lag leaves it easy to punish if shielded of missed."
"586","Samus","Dash attack","","7% (early), 10% (clean), 6% (late)","A shoulder tackle with a white aura around Samus, similar to the Shinespark technique from her home series. Deals more damage and knockback near the middle of the attack, KOing opponents at around 150% from the center of Final Destination, and earlier near edges. However, the early and late hits are noticeably weaker, and the move lacks combo potential, especially compared to its previous appearance."
"587","Samus","Forward smash","","13% (Arm Cannon), 15% (blast)","Quickly thrusts her Arm Cannon forward to fire a small, fiery blast. Functions similarly to Mario's forward smash, with the blast being the most powerful part of the move. It is one of the fastest forward smashes in the game, coming out on frame 10, while the blast has enough knockback to KO at around 100% from center stage. However, it is rather weak otherwise, with the Arm Cannon KOing at around 135%. It can be angled like her forward tilt, with the upward angle dealing more damage and knockback, though it can typically miss as a result; conversely, the downward angle can hit ledge hanging opponents, but deals slightly less damage and knockback."

"590","Samus","Up smash","Cover Fire","3% (hits 1-4), 6% (hit 5)","Fires five fiery blasts in an overhead arcing motion. True to its name, this move works best as an anti-air attack, as its multiple hits give a good amount of aerial protection. Conversely, it is unable to hit grounded opponents unless they are close enough to Samus. It is also her most damaging smash attack, dealing 18% total uncharged. However, due to its hits being spread above Samus, it can fail to fully connect if the opponent is hit from too far."
"591","Samus","Down smash","","10% (front), 12% (back)","A legsweep. A semi-spike with decent speed and high base knockback, allowing it to set up edgeguards and punish rolls effectively. However, it is relatively weak from center stage, with the front hit not KOing until around 200%."
"592","Samus","Neutral aerial","","10% (hit 1), 9% (hit 2, clean), 8% (hit 2, late)","A spinning roundhouse kick, similar to her counterattack in Metroid: Other M. Hits on both sides quickly and can autocancel with a short hopped fast fall. Its front  hit and sweetspotted back hit also deal powerful knockback, which makes it a viable KOing option offstage or near the edge, as well as a decent combo finisher and one of the strongest aerials of its type."
"593","Samus","Forward aerial","","3% (hit 1), 1.6% (hits 2-4), 5% (hit 5)","Fires five fiery blasts in a slow, downward arcing motion. Fast, coming out on frame 6. The first four hits drag opponents into the rest of the move using the autolink angle, with the last hit carrying the entire attack's knockback. Samus' main aerial move for both combos and protection. Extremely useful as an edge get-up option or against air dodges due to its multiple hits, and using the move immediately after a short hop can hit opponents with the last hit before Samus lands again. It's her only aerial that does not autocancels In a short hop."
"594","Samus","Back aerial","","14% (clean foot), 12% (clean leg), 9% (late)","A back kick. It is fast and deals powerful knockback when sweetspotted, which makes it an excellent KOing option, especially when edgeguarding. When sweetspotted, it is among the strongest back aerials in the game, KOing at around 110% from center stage."
"595","Samus","Up aerial","","3% (hit 1), 1.3% (hits 2-5), 4% (hit 5)","A diagonal corkscrew flying kick, hitting multiple times. It is her fastest aerial, due to coming out on frame 5. Grounded opponents can be hit by the last hitbox if Samus lands while starting the move in the air, although it is difficult to do so, and risky due to the move's high landing lag. It can be used as a follow-up after a dash attack, grounded up tilt, down aerial, or down throw, all of which can be followed up with another up aerial and/or can be finished off with a Screw Attack. On stages with platforms, it even has potential for a zero-to-death when using a platform to extend the combo. Can KO if used high enough and close to the blast line."
"596","Samus","Down aerial","","10% (early, late), 14% (clean)","Swings her Arm Cannon in a downward arcing motion. Hitting with the move's trail meteor smashes opponents, while the edges of the move at the very start and end deal decent horizontal knockback. Autocancels from a short hop, and due to its relatively low ending lag, the meteor smash is excellent for starting combos on grounded opponents, much like her up tilt."
"597","Samus","Grab aerial","Grapple Beam","1.5% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2)","Fires the Grapple Beam. A useful spacing option due to having only 8 frames of landing lag. It autocancels from a full hop and has impressive range, being the longest grab aerial in game. In addition to its recovery and spacing capabilities, it is good at setting up combos at close range upon landing, due to its low landing lag. Unlike in previous games, however, hitting an opponents causes the Grapple Beam to retract earlier, while not reducing the move's ending lag."
"598","Samus","Grab","Grapple Beam","—","Fires the Grapple Beam. It has impressive range and is the longest tether grab in the game. However, it is tied with her Zero Suited form's grab as the second slowest in terms of ending lag, making it very punishable if missed."
"599","Samus","Pummel","","1.3%","A palm strike. Has moderate damage and speed relative to other pummels."
"600","Samus","Forward throw","","10%","Twirls the opponent overhead, then flings them forward. Although its knockback has been increased, it remains too weak for KOing at realistic percents, unless Samus has rage and is at the edge of the stage."
"601","Samus","Back throw","","10%","Swings the opponent behind herself. Slightly more effective for KOing and setting up edgeguards than her forward throw, due to its lower launch angle."
"602","Samus","Up throw","","5% (hit 1), 7% (throw)","Puts the opponent above herself and blasts them upward with her Arm Cannon. Samus's most damaging and strongest throw, possessing enough knockback to KO middleweights under 190% from ground level and without rage. At low percents, it can also combo into an up aerial against large characters, as well as Screw Attack against most characters, though the latter will only connect its hits reliably on a few characters."
"603","Samus","Down throw","","8%","Swings the opponent high above her head, then slams them onto the ground. A reliable combo starter, with its followups including a dash attack, small step forward smash or dashing up smash at low percents, a neutral, back or up aerial up to mid percents, and a forward aerial up to high percents."
"604","Samus","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings her Arm Cannon in front of herself and then fires a blast behind herself."

"607","Samus","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a legsweep while climbing up."
"608","Samus","Neutral special","Charge Shot","5% (uncharged), 28% (fully charged)","Charges a ball of energy and fires it. Boasts excellent KO potential when fully charged, and is a useful intercepting move at a low charge. KOs at 70%-110% depending on rage and the opponent's weight and DI. Can be used to break shields if used in conjunction with her neutral attack, up or down tilts, aerials, Bomb and Super Missile. When using her forward tilt to launch the opponent into tumbling, it can set up a guaranteed combo into Charge Shot regardless of the opponent's tech option, as Charge Shot will always catch their tech direction."
"609","Samus","Side special","Missile","8% (Homing), 12% (Super)","Fires a Missile, which homes in on the opponent. If the special button is tapped like a smash attack, Samus will instead fire a Super Missile, which stays in place for a short while before traveling in a straight line, and deals more damage and knockback. Both variations deal low knockback, but can be used to break a shield if used in conjunction with a fully charged Charge Shot. Both Missile variations can also be used as set-ups by opening up an opportunity for a grab aerial, or Charge Shot, while the Super variation sets up better for a true combo into a forward jumping Charge Shot at high percentages. The Homing variation is also useful for catching recoveries and forcing air dodges, which can open up punishment opportunities."
"610","Samus","Up special","Screw Attack","3% (grounded hit 1), 1% (grounded hits 2-8), 2% (grounded hit 9), 1% (aerial hits 1-12)","Leaps upward to perform a high-speed somersault while discharging energy. Shoots upward if initiated from the ground, while it gains distance slower if started in the air. A useful out of shield option, due to coming out on frame 4 on the ground, and deals good knockback that can KO around 100% while near the upper blast line."
"611","Samus","Down special","Bomb","4% (contact), 5% (explosion)","Rolls into her Morph Ball form and drops a Bomb, which explodes after a set time. Useful to force an opponent to shield and for edgeguarding, being capable of 2 frame punishes if timed correctly. It can also break shields depending on their health if used along with her up and down tilts or a fully charged Charge Shot."
"612","Samus","Final Smash","Zero Laser","0.5% (fringe loop), 1.5% (main loop), 2.5% (fringe blast), 5.5% (main blast)","Fires a very large, bluish white energy beam. The beam can be angled vertically during the Final Smash."
"613","Kirby","Neutral attack","Vulcan Jab/Smash Punch","1.8%","A one-two combo. When button mashed, Kirby performs the Vulcan Jab from the Fighter ability before concluding with the Smash Punch, also from the Fighter ability. It is very quick due to coming out on frame 3, and its first two hits have very minimal ending lag. These traits make it effective for jab canceling or as an out of shield option."
"614","Kirby","Neutral attack","Vulcan Jab/Smash Punch","1.6%","A one-two combo. When button mashed, Kirby performs the Vulcan Jab from the Fighter ability before concluding with the Smash Punch, also from the Fighter ability.

"616","Kirby","Forward tilt","","8% (base), 7% (tip)","Throws a spinning roundhouse kick. It is quick, due to coming out on frame 5, having very little ending lag and can be angled. Due to its above average knockback, it can KO middleweights starting at around 132% at the edge of Final Destination."
"617","Kirby","Up tilt","","5% (clean), 4% (late)","A scorpion kick. Although its damage output is low, it is a very useful combo starter at low percents, especially on fast-fallers, due to it coming out on frame 4 and having both minimal ending lag and disjointed range which slightly reaches behind him. It also renders Kirby's foot intangible throughout its duration."
"618","Kirby","Down tilt","Squish Kick","6%","A crouching shin kick. It is fairly spammable due to coming out on frame 4 and having minimal ending lag. When coupled with its tripping potential, it can be a very useful set-up option."
"619","Kirby","Dash attack","Burn","12% (clean), 9% (mid), 6% (late)","The Burn attack from the Fire ability. It has decent start up at frame 9 with a lengthy hitbox that grows weaker over time. When struck cleanly, it has great power,  KOing middleweights at around 98% from the edge of Final Destination."
"620","Kirby","Forward smash","Smash Kick","15% (clean), 11% (late)","The Spin Kick from the Fighter ability. Due to becoming active at frame 13, it's fast for a forward smash. It can be angled and moderately moves Kirby forward, giving it deceptive range. Its clean hitbox also deals respectable damage and has very high knockback growth, which makes it a powerful and reliable KOing option. While near the edge of Final Destination, it KOs middleweights at around 80%. However, its late hitbox lacks reliable KO potential."
"621","Kirby","Up smash","","15%/14% (clean), 14%/13% (mid), 13%/12% (late)","A bicycle kick. It can hit behind Kirby, while its clean hitbox deals respectable damage and has very high knockback growth like forward smash. It clean hitbox KOs middleweights at around 110% from anywhere on Final Destination. Kirby's foot is also rendered intangible throughout its duration. However, its mid and late hitboxes lack KO potential. Comes out on frame 12 and has 29 frames of ending lag, so it's speed is only average for an up smash."
"622","Kirby","Down smash","","14% (clean), 10% (late)","A spinning split kick. It hits in front of and behind Kirby, and its clean hitbox deals respectable damage and has very high knockback growth like his forward and up smashes. Comes out on frame 10. Semispike with above average power, with its clean hitbox KOing middleweights at around 103% from the edge of Final Destination. It also renders Kirby's feet intangible, albeit only during its clean hitbox. However, its late hitbox has significantly lower KO potential."
"623","Kirby","Neutral aerial","Twinkle Star","10% (clean), 8% (mid), 6% (mid-to-late), 4% (late)","A cartwheel, similar to the aerial attack from the Smash ability. Its very low landing lag makes it a decent set-up option at low percents or a tool for shield pressure when short hopped, while it's surprisingly high knockback growth makes it a decent anti-pressure and out of shield option. It has big hitboxes, especially at the beginning, giving good protection and coverage around Kirby. It can also edgeguard, but it has the highest amount of ending lag out of Kirby's aerials, although much safer than in SSB4 since its ending lag was reduced drastically. Despite having sex kick properties, it also has noticeable startup lag at frame 10, tied with forward and up aerials. Autocancels in a full hop."
"624","Kirby","Forward aerial","","4% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2), 5% (hit 3)","The Aerial Spin Kick from the Fighter ability. The first two hits have low knockback, which allows them to connect reliably with the third hit. Its low landing lag also allows the first or second hit to be used as set-up options into other moves, such as an up smash or forward smash at high percents. Good for combos. Can connect into itself for a Wall of Pain in certain instances. Autocancels in a full hop."
"625","Kirby","Back aerial","","13% (clean), 8% (late)","A dropkick. It functions as a sex kick, but also has the lowest amount of start-up lag out of Kirby's aerials, due to it coming out on frame 6. It autocancels from  a short hop and its clean hitbox also deals the most damage out of his aerials, and possesses very high knockback growth, which make it a viable KOing option. While near the edge of Final Destination, its clean hitbox KOs middleweights at around 105%. It also boasts good range due to its slightly disjointed hitbox, which makes it a viable edge-guarding option, and allows it to use it in a wall of pain."
"626","Kirby","Up aerial","","9%","The Moon Somersault Kick from the Fighter ability. A decent juggling option, it can also be used for continuing a combo due to its low landing lag. Autocancels in a short hop."
"627","Kirby","Down aerial","","1.3% (hits 1-5), 2% (hit 6), 2% (landing)","A diagonal corkscrew dropkick. An effective combo starter on grounded opponents and, due to the last hit being a weak meteor smash, it is a useful edge-guarding option, especially since its low ending lag makes it relatively safe to use off-stage. It can even lead into a footstool jump on fast-fallers and heavyweights. While it has the highest amount of start-up lag out of Kirby's aerials due to coming out on frame 18, and not autocanceling in a short hop, it can be auto-canceled on landing, giving Kirby a very large window to safely land while tumbling. Despite possessing a landing hit, it's landing lag is only moderate, with 16 frames,making it safe even if not autocanceled."
"628","Kirby","Grab","","—","The Foe Grab from the Fighter ability. One of the fastest grabs, but has short range. Kirby's throws are based on attacks used by the Suplex and Ninja abilities."
"629","Kirby","Pummel","","1%","The punch version of the Arm Throw from the Fighter ability. Weak, but one of the fastest pummels."
"630","Kirby","Forward throw","","5%","The Pile Driver from the Suplex ability. Unlike the majority of forward throws, it possesses combo potential. Its most reliable follow-ups are neutral, forward and down aerials at low percents, and up aerial and Final Cutter at medium percents. Using it below a Battlefield platform will have Kirby land on said platform, hindering followups at lower percents, but extending them at higher percents."
"631","Kirby","Back throw","","8%","The Big Suplex from the Suplex ability. Despite having an average damage output and very low base knockback, it has very high knockback growth. As a result, it  has decent KO potential. While near the edge of Final Destination, it KOs middleweights at around 137%."
"632","Kirby","Up throw","Air Drop","10% (throw), 7% (landing)","The attack of the same name from the Ninja ability. Like Meta Knight's up throw, it can damage and launch bystanders upon landing. It is weaker than his back throw when used at the edge, but it is consistently strong regardless of where it's used on the stage. Great knockback, KOing middleweights at around 158% from anywhere on Final Destination, and the landing hit can KO at around 157%. Because Kirby jumps up to perform it, he can land onto platforms above him upon descending, which enables it to KO even earlier."
"633","Kirby","Down throw","","1% (hits 1-10), 2% (throw)","The Fury Stomp from the Suplex ability. It is Kirby's most damaging throw at 12%, which makes it useful for damage racking. It can also damage nearby opponents."
"634","Kirby","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Performs a spin kick before getting up."
"635","Kirby","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Kicks on one side and then the other before getting up."
"636","Kirby","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","The Break Spin from the Yo-yo ability."
"637","Kirby","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a cartwheeling kick while climbing up. It has surprisingly good range compared to many other characters' edge attacks."
"638","Kirby","Neutral special","Inhale","10% (swallow), 6% (spit)","Inhales the opponent. It has a grabbox and can be held indefinitely. Upon Inhaling an opponent, Kirby can spit them out as a star to deal damage to them and any nearby opponents, copy their neutral special move, or walk around slowly and/or perform a short hop. However, the opponent can escape from Kirby's mouth via button mashing. Some characters will give Kirby a slight variation of their neutral special due to mechanics that would not work properly when copied, such as Luma Shot and Pikmin Pluck. When inhaling projectiles, Kirby will heal off a small amount of percentage, and when inhaling large projectiles, such as Samus's fully charged Charge Shot, it can be spat out as a star. Kirby' s copied neutral special's damage output has a x1.2 multiplier compared the opponent's version."
"639","Kirby","Side special","Hammer Flip","19% (grounded uncharged), 16% (aerial uncharged), 35% (grounded fully charged), 28% (aerial fully charged)","The attack of the same name from the Hammer ability. It is chargeable and, when fully charged, Kirby's hammer will ignite and deal recoil damage. He can also slowly walk and jump while charging it, while a fully charged Hammer Flip grants armor during part of the swing. When it is used in midair, Kirby will swing his hammer twice. While near the edge of Final Destination, uncharged Hammer Flip KOs middleweights at around 65%. Conversely, fully charged Hammer Flip KOs middleweights at around 6%. Although weaker, aerial Hammer Flip nevertheless possesses impressive KO potential. While near the edge of Final Destination, it KOs middleweights at around 86%. Conversely, its fully charged version KOs them at around 33%. When fully charged and on the ground, it makes Kirby invincible from frame 2-10 and gives him super armor from frame 11-17. Despite this power, the move is considered essentially useless in competitive play outside of shield break punishes due to its small hitbox, terrible startup, and huge endlag."
"640","Kirby","Up special","Final Cutter","5% (ascent), 2% (descent), 5% (landing), 6% (shockwave)","The attack of the same name from the Cutter ability. It can meteor smash any opponents he comes into contact with upon descending. The sword also emits a shockwave upon hitting a solid surface, which is Kirby's only projectile aside from spitting out an Inhaled opponent. A good vertical recovery move and has decent horizontal distance when angled. However, it is extremely predictable due to its high start-up. Kirby cannot sweetspot the edge until he starts to descend, and if the platform beneath him disappears or if he is pushed off while he is still in the landing animation, he will be rendered helpless."
"641","Kirby","Down special","Stone","18% (impact), 14% (shockwave)","The Stone Change (while Kirby is on the ground) and the Stone Smash (while Kirby is in the air) from the Stone ability. Thanks to its high damage output, Stone Smash KOs middleweights at around 108% and deals considerable shield damage. It can also be canceled in midair by pressing the special button, which can be used for mindgames. Although Stone Change is slightly weaker, it is a semi-spike. Kirby cannot be damaged while he is transformed, although his Stone forms have a set amount of durability, and he can be grabbed while transformed."
"642","Kirby","Final Smash","Ultra Sword","3% (stun), 5% (hit 1), 2.5% (hits 2-9), 16% (hit 10)","The Super Ability of the same name. Kirby wields a gigantic sword to repeatedly slash the opponent before enlarging the sword and then concluding with a powerful downward slash. While near the edge of Final Destination, it KOs middleweights at around 15%."
"643","Meta Knight","Neutral attack","Flurry Attack","1% (loop), 2% (final hit)","Performs an extremely fast series of slashes followed by a backflipping slash. It is notably the only neutral attack in the game that consists solely of a neutral infinite. It appears to be based on the Meta Multithrust from Meta Knightmare Ultra, while its finisher is a possible reference to the Uppercut from the Sword ability in Kirby Super Star and Kirby Super Star Ultra, with the latter game naming it Meta Upper when it is used by Meta Knight."
"644","Meta Knight","Forward tilt","","2%","An inward slash followed by an outward slash, followed by an upward slash. Unlike the majority of tilt attacks (with an exception to the side tilts of Snake, Bayonetta, Piranha Plant, and Hero and the down tilts of the Belmonts), it functions like a neutral attack, as pressing the attack button will cause Meta Knight to perform its first hit, while subsequently pressing the attack button will cause him to perform its second and last hits."
"645","Meta Knight","Forward tilt","","2%","An inward slash followed by an outward slash, followed by an upward slash. Unlike the majority of tilt attacks (with an exception to the side tilts of Snake, Bayonetta, Piranha Plant, and Hero and the down tilts of the Belmonts), it functions like a neutral attack, as pressing the attack button will cause Meta Knight to perform its first hit, while subsequently pressing the attack button will cause him to perform its second and last hits."

Unlike the majority of tilt attacks (with an exception to the side tilts of Snake, Bayonetta, Piranha Plant, and Hero and the down tilts of the Belmonts), it functions like a neutral attack, as pressing the attack button will cause Meta Knight to perform its first hit, while subsequently pressing the attack button will cause him to perform its second and last hits."
"647","Meta Knight","Up tilt","","7% (sweetspot), 6% (clean sourspot), 5% (late sourspot)","A spinning, upward thrust. There is a sweetspot located in Galaxia's tip. Has poor horizontal range, causing it to miss unless its used point-blank to the opponent. It can conbo however."
"648","Meta Knight","Down tilt","","5%","A low sword thrust. May cause tripping and can lock at low percents."
"649","Meta Knight","Dash attack","","7% (leg), 6% (foot)","A sliding side kick."
"650","Meta Knight","Forward smash","","16%","An outwards slash. Due to it hitting on frame 24, it is his slowest standard attack in terms of start-up lag. In addition, its hitbox only lasts for 1 frame. However it's powerful and has low ending lag."
"651","Meta Knight","Up smash","","4% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2), 5% (hit 3)","A series of upward fanning slashes. Despite its appearance, it is only able to hit opponents directly touching Galaxia. However, it will hit a target that has a large hurtbox. It's not safe on shield, and it's power is poor."
"652","Meta Knight","Down smash","","10% (front), 13% (back)","A spinning, low-angle outward slash on both sides of himself. Both hits are semi-spikes, which makes it useful for warding off pressure, punishing rolls, and launching opponents off-stage. The front hit is weak though."
"653","Meta Knight","Neutral aerial","","10% (clean), 7.5% (late)","A somersaulting slash with sex kick properties. It may be based on the Knight Spin from Meta Knightmare Ultra. Autocancels in a full hop and is one of the strongest in the game, KOing reliably below 150%."
"654","Meta Knight","Forward aerial","","1.5% (hits 1 and 2), 3% (hit 3)","Performs three quick fanning slashes in front of himself.Does not autocancel in a short hop."
"655","Meta Knight","Back aerial","","1.5% (hits 1 and 2), 4% (hit 3)","Performs three spinning outward slashes behind himself. When used during a fast-fall, the first two hits can drag midair opponents towards the ground. Does not autocancel in a short hop."
"656","Meta Knight","Up aerial","Midair Up Sweep","4%","An upward arcing slash above himself. Based on his jumping attack from Kirby's Adventure."
"657","Meta Knight","Down aerial","","6%","A downward arcing slash below himself."
"658","Meta Knight","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his free hand. Very short range."
"659","Meta Knight","Pummel","","1%","Jabs with one of the talons on his cape's wings."
"660","Meta Knight","Forward throw","","6% (hit), 3% (throw)","A bicycle kick. It can no longer combo due to changes to traction."
"661","Meta Knight","Back throw","","7% (hit), 3% (throw)","Teleports behind the opponent and then slashes their back, launching them away."
"662","Meta Knight","Up throw","","10% (throw), 7% (collateral)","Performs the Air Drop from Kirby's Ninja ability. Unlike Kirby's up throw, the impact doesn't have an aesthetic explosion."
"663","Meta Knight","Down throw","Trample","0.5% (hits 1-9), 1% (hit 10), 2% (throw)","Performs the Fury Stomp from Kirby's Suplex ability. It is weaker compared to Kirby's down throw, and the duration is slightly slower."
"664","Meta Knight","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Slashes around himself."
"665","Meta Knight","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Slashes around himself."
"666","Meta Knight","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Slashes around himself."
"667","Meta Knight","Edge attack","","9%","Performs an outward slash while climbing up."
"668","Meta Knight","Neutral special","Mach Tornado","12% (clean), 8% (late)","Spins rapidly and traps opponents in a tornado. Button mashing increases the move's duration and makes Meta Knight both ascend slightly; he can also move left and right. Unlike its previous versions, the tornado only consists of one hit. Using this move in midair renders Meta Knight helpless. It is based on the Mach Tornado attack from his boss fight in Kirby Super Star. It is also similar to Kirby's Tornado ability."
"669","Meta Knight","Side special","Drill Rush","1.1% (hits 1-11), 3% (hit 12)","Meta Knight rushes sideways, spinning in the fashion of a drill with Galaxia outstretched. The flight path can be maneuvered up or down, allowing it to function as a recovery option (although it will render him helpless). Meta Knight will also bounce backward if he lands the last hit on an opponent or onto terrain. Based off of the attack of the same name from Kirby's Master ability."
"670","Meta Knight","Up special","Shuttle Loop","9% (ground hit 1, clean), 6% (ground hit 1, late; ground hit 2; aerial hits 1 and 2)","Meta Knight jumps high into the air, slashing with Galaxia pointed upwards. He then swoops downward and rises upward in a fast loop, slashing a second time during the ascent. The speed, range, and power of this move, as well as its follow-up potential, makes it one of Meta Knight's best KO moves. However, due to Meta Knight being left helpless, it is highly punishable if whiffed. Based off of the attack of the same name from Kirby's Wing ability, as well as Meta Knight's use of the move in Kirby's Return to Dream Land, Kirby: Planet Robobot, and Kirby Star Allies."
"671","Meta Knight","Down special","Dimensional Cape","16% (advancing/stationary), 13% (grounded, retreating), 14% (aerial, retreating)","Meta Knight wraps himself in his cape and teleports to the direction inputted. He is granted intangibility during the move's execution (frames 12-39). Holding the attack/special button, however, will have him perform a very powerful slash upon reappearing (frame 34). The damage depends on what direction he teleports. This move can also be used as a recovery option, though it does render Meta Knight helpless."
"672","Meta Knight","Final Smash","Darkness Illusion","3% (trapping hit), 27.6% (flurry attack), 10% (launch)","Meta Knight's cape turns into 2 pairs of wings as he raises Galaxia skyward. A lightning bolt strikes the sword and spreads out in a cross-shaped burst, knocking anybody who touches it up and above the stage. Meta Knight then proceeds to launch a series of rushing slashes from multiple directions, ending with a final slash that knocks the opponent away."
"673","King Dedede","Neutral attack","","2.5%","A pair of hammer swings, followed by thrusting his hammer forward while twirling its head, followed by an upward swing. Unlike most neutral infinites, its finisher launches opponents at a nearly vertical trajectory and has KO potential, as it KOs around 150% without rage. It is much faster than it was in SSB4, and connects more reliably."
"674","King Dedede","Neutral attack","","2.2%","A pair of hammer swings, followed by thrusting his hammer forward while twirling its head, followed by an upward swing. Unlike most neutral infinites, its finisher launches opponents at a nearly vertical trajectory and has KO potential, as it KOs around 150% without rage. It is much faster than it was in SSB4, and connects more reliably."
"675","King Dedede","Neutral attack","","0.5% (loop), 3% (last)","A pair of hammer swings, followed by thrusting his hammer forward while twirling its head, followed by an upward swing. Unlike most neutral infinites, its finisher launches opponents at a nearly vertical trajectory and has KO potential, as it KOs around 150% without rage. It is much faster than it was in SSB4, and connects more reliably."
"676","King Dedede","Forward tilt","","2% (hits 1-4), 3% (hit 5)","Thrusts his hammer forward while twirling its head. Very good range, though its fourth hitbox can only connect if the move lands at the tip of the hammer. However, its rather long ending lag makes this move unsafe if it does not connect at its farthest range. It is very useful for Dedede's ledge traps as its speed, range, and long lasting hitbox allows it to trap rolls and neutral get ups, but this is less rewarding than using his smash attacks. Also good for catching landings when reversed out of a run, and can stuff out punish attempts for a landed back aerial."
"677","King Dedede","Up tilt","","10% (head & neck), 8% (tip of head)","An upward headbutt. King Dedede's head and upper body are intangible while its hitbox is active. Can combo into itself at low percents, and has limited KO potential at very high percents."
"678","King Dedede","Down tilt","Rolling","10% (early), 6% (late)","A cartwheeling tackle. Dedede's fastest move, coming out on frame 6. It is capable of being used after most defensive options and attacks, as a good out of shield option, or for disrupting opponents. Can also lead into itself and other attacks if the opponent does not tech."
"679","King Dedede","Dash attack","Belly Flop","16% (clean), 13% (late)","His signature belly flopping tackle. A slow and powerful KOing option, it is the strongest dash attack in the game and is even stronger than some of the cast's smash attacks, KOing middleweights at around 55% near the edge due to its exceptionally high knockback. The attack can be used for a hard read or setting up tech-chases. Can hit every character on the ledge after their ledge invincibility has ended. However, its high ending lag causes the attack to be very punishable when missed. Originates from Kirby's Dream Land."
"680","King Dedede","Forward smash","","16% (head, early), 25% (head, late), 18.5% (handle),  11% (shockwave)","Rears his hammer back and slams it down. The most damaging and strongest forward smash in the game. It can KO as early as 30% near the edge, even when uncharged, and when fully charged, it is even capable of OHKOing some lighter characters like Pichu near the edge of Final Destination. It has very slow startup, but deceptively short endlag and a long-ranged quakebox. It can break shields point blank with only a little bit of charging. Originates from Kirby's Dream Land."
"681","King Dedede","Up smash","","16% (hammer), 10% (body)","An upward hammer swing. A decent anti-air option with great vertical knockback, KOing at middleweights at 100%. Has good range in front and behind Dedede with consistent power throughout the duration, being able to hit short characters unlike in SSB4. It also has transcendent priority."
"682","King Dedede","Down smash","","13%","A spinning hammer swing around himself. King Dedede's fastest kill move, sending foes at a low angle and can KO around 80% near the edge. Best used for catching rolls as well as ledge attacks. It also has transcendent priority. Appears very similar to the Giant Dedede Swing from Kirby's Return to Dream Land."
"683","King Dedede","Neutral aerial","","12% (clean), 7% (late)","A splash. Dedede's fastest aerial, coming out on frame 7. Functions like a sex kick, but unlike the majority of them, it has transcendent priority, meaning that it cannot cancel out projectiles. When coupled with a fast fall, its late hit has follow-up potential, such as an up tilt at low percents, neutral, forward or back air at mid percents, and up air at higher percents."
"684","King Dedede","Forward aerial","","12%","Somersaults to perform a downward hammer swing. Has good range in front of Dedede, but can be unsafe on hit at lower percents if spaced poorly. This move does not autocancel in a short hop and has more landing and ending lag than his back aerial, but starts much earlier. Is capable of performing a pseudo wall of pain while edgeguarding. It can also lock and fend off edgeguard attempts while recovering, due to its long range reaching through ledges."
"685","King Dedede","Back aerial","","16%","A horizontal hammer swing behind himself. One of Dedede's best moves for spacing and KOing, doing so reliably below 120%. Can be autocanceled in a short hop, and is also relatively safe on shield when spaced at max range."
"686","King Dedede","Up aerial","","1% (hits 1-7), 5% (hit 8)","Thrusts his hammer upward while twirling its head. Has tremendous reach above Dedede, and can beat out numerous down aerials. It is quite strong for a multi-hit move, being able to KO below 130%. Like his forward aerial, it can hit edgeguarding opponents through ledges."
"687","King Dedede","Down aerial","","15% (middle of head), 8% (edge of head)","A downward hammer swing. The sweetspot is a very powerful aerial-only meteor smash. The meteor smash only activates at 28% or higher. On grounded opponents, it deals high horizontal knockback, KOing at around 100% near the edge. However, its usage is very limited due to its high startup, causing it to be Dedede's slowest aerial."
"688","King Dedede","Grab","","—","Reaches out. King Dedede's grab range is average."
"689","King Dedede","Pummel","","1.6%","A headbutt. Quicker but less damaging than it was in Smash 4. Good for racking damage."
"690","King Dedede","Forward throw","","4% (hit 1), 6% (throw)","Strikes the opponent forward with his hammer. Can be used to set up an edgeguard or launch the opponent into a previously thrown Gordo."
"691","King Dedede","Back throw","","4% (hit 1), 9% (throw)","Strikes the opponent backward with his hammer. King Dedede's strongest throw, but due to the fact that it launches at a very high angle, it does not KO until very high percentages, depending on the opponent's weight and DI. It is better at damage racking due to these factors. Like forward throw, it can be used to launch the opponent into a previously thrown Gordo."
"692","King Dedede","Up throw","","4% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","A jump set, a technique used in volleyball. Can lead into up aerial at low to medium percentages, but down throw is generally more rewarding and consistent. Like forward throw, can be used to launch the opponent into a previously thrown Gordo."
"693","King Dedede","Down throw","","6%","A one-handed body slam. King Dedede's best combo starter, it can initiate true combos into a neutral or forward aerial at very low percents and back air at low to mid percents. At medium percentages, down throw to up aerial is a KO combo if the opponent DIs incorrectly."
"694","King Dedede","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Gets up and kicks in front of himself and then behind himself."
"695","King Dedede","Floor attack (back)","","7%",""
"696","King Dedede","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings his hammer in of himself and then behind himself while twirling the hammer's head."
"697","King Dedede","Edge attack","","10%","Performs a kick while climbing up."
"698","King Dedede","Neutral special","Inhale","12% (spit)","Inhales the opponent. While they have been Inhaled, King Dedede can then walk around and spit them out to inflict damage. He will also receive a 0.25x Received Knockback Multiplier, making it almost impossible to KO him while someone is inhaled. Inhale can also be used to swallow items and spit back projectiles, acting as a reflector. The reflector property is quite notable as unlike the rest of the cast, it has no reflect limit. Inhale is also a good landing mix-up to catch sidesteps and shields."
"699","King Dedede","Side special","Gordo Throw","10% (hammer), 14%/12.5%/11%/9.5% (Gordo)","Hits a bouncing Gordo with his hammer. Its trajectory can be angled upward, forward, or downward, which can be used for mindgames. By extension, his throws can be used to launch the opponent toward a previously thrown Gordo. The Gordos disappear after almost 3 seconds. An upward-angled gordo can be used to deny most options at the ledge or even all when combined with an attack. Gordo can also stick to any surface that allows wall jumping, and is much consistent than it was in SSB4. They can also be reflected by any attack dealing at least 2%. Of further note is that Dedede can hit opponents with the hammer swing used to serve the Gordo, potentially leading into a hit by both the hammer and Gordo for a considerable amount of damage. Dedede can also inhale his own Gordo and spit it out at a considerable speed."
"700","King Dedede","Up special","Super Dedede Jump","15% (drop), 12% (landing), 5% (stars)","His signature jump. It concludes with a diving double foot stomp that buries grounded opponents and meteor smashes aerial ones. Like Yoshi Bomb, it emits stars on both sides after the diving double foot stomp hits the ground, which can make it difficult to punish, especially against characters that lack a projectile. While it cannot grab edges during its descent, it can do so upon being canceled. However, if it is canceled too late before landing, Dedede will endure landing lag that lasts for more than a second."
"701","King Dedede","Down special","Jet Hammer","12% (uncharged grounded), 11% (uncharged aerial), 40% (fully charged grounded), 32% (fully charged aerial)","Activates the afterburner in his hammer to charge up a very powerful swing, which is released when the special button is released. Dedede can walk around slowly and jump once while charging. It has heavy armor during the swing, and it can hit opponents hanging from the ledge after their invincibility wears off. The jet hammer will inflict the most amount of knock back if released just before the full charge. Dedede can hold the hammer out indefinitely, but it slowly deals recoil damage if he holds it when fully charged up until 100%. A fully charged Jet Hammer can easily KO opponents below 50% near the edge, and is able to break shields with a full charge."
"702","King Dedede","Final Smash","Dede-Rush","8% (hit 1), 1.8% (missiles), 20% (hammer hit), 10% (last hit)","Strikes the opponent with his hammer sending them into his trademark boxing ring with a cage set up. Adopting his Masked Dedede persona, he attacks his opponent with a barrage of missiles, followed by a powerful spinning hammer swing. Deals approximately 60% in total with considerable knockback, but can only trap one opponent at a time."
"703","Fox","Neutral attack","","1.7%","Two alternating jabs followed by a flurry of kicks, ending with a mid-level roundhouse kick with his opposite leg. Quick start-up time (frame 2) means that dash-cancelling into jab is a solid approach option in neutral, is a good spotdodge punish option and is a reliable move for breaking non true grounded combos. Compared to Smash 4, the jab can lock and the rapid jab connects better, making it a more effective damage racking tool at almost any percentage. However, it can no longer jab cancel into other moves. Good combo finisher, most notably with early hit neutral aerial at low percentages. However, the rapid jab finisher has high endlag, making it very punishable on shield."

"706","Fox","Forward tilt","","7%","A roundhouse kick with good startup (frame 6), very low endlag and decent range, making it good for spacing. However, it's not safe on shield if not spaced properly. Has transcendent priority, which allows it to ignore or trade with other moves. Can be angled up or down, both of which deal more damage and knockback than if not angled. Using this move repeatedly causes Fox to move slightly forward. Angling it down may hit the opponents hanging on the ledge. May cause tripping at low percentages. Using forward tilt at low percentages can combo into itself once more, at low-mid percentages can lead into dash attack and at mid percentages can lead to tech chase and jab lock opportunities."

Has an extremely fast startup for a tilt (frame 3), which can make it a good option for surprising the opponents and is his most reliable option to use after perfect shielding. Compared to Smash 4, the hitboxes are moved higher up, which makes it impossible to 2-frame punish but is better as an anti aerial move. A purple trail indicates the hitbox, starting behind and ending in front of him. It's not safe on shield, making it punishable. Combos into itself along with jab, down tilt, forward tilt, up smash (at higher percents), neutral air, up air, back air and several other moves. Fox's strongest tilt attack when sweetspotted, although it will only start KOing Mario at around 215% on Final Destination."
"710","Fox","Down tilt","","8% (close), 7% (far)","Fox spins while crouching, sweeping with his tail. Comes out on frame 7 and can 2-frame punish certain opponents if timed properly. One of his best combo starters due to the new launch angle - can lead into up smash, neutral air, down air, back air, forward air, and in case the opponent DIs towards Fox, up air."
"711","Fox","Dash attack","","6% (clean), 4% (late)","A flying kick with great startup (frame 4) and low endlag. Good approach option in neutral that can lead to a jab, up tilt, up smash, neutral air or down air follow-up. The late hit can combo into forward aerial at mid or up smash as a KO setup at higher percentages, while the early hit can follow up into forward or up aerial depending on the opponent's reaction. However, it stops on shield unless done at point blank range, making it punishable."
"712","Fox","Forward smash","","14% (clean), 11% (late)","An outwards crescent kick. Fox's only non special move that has more than 10 frames of startup (13 frames), but has decent endlag compared to his other smash attacks, making it somewhat hard to punish on whiff, but is still punishable on shield. It has good range since Fox somersaults forward. It has a decent duration for a smash attack, making it reliable for punishing regular ledge getups. Has somewhat low base knockback for a forward smash, but decent knockback growth. KOs Mario at around 92% near the ledge and at around 127% at the center of Final Destination. The late hit is capable of hitting opponents on the ledge, while also having a decent knockback near the ledge, KOing Mario at around 116% near the ledge of Final Destination, albeit failing to KO until around 160% at the center of Final Destination."
"713","Fox","Up smash","Flip Kick","16% (clean), 11% (late)","A bicycle kick with good horizontal and great vertical range. One of Fox's primary KO moves. Very fast (frame 8), has high knockback and even has reliable KO setups to it, most notably falling late neutral aerial to up smash. However, due to high ending lag, it is very punishable if shielded or whiffed. Late hit also has a significantly weaker knockback and can only KO the opponents near the ledge at very high percentages. Can hit opponents standing on top of some platforms, like lower platforms on Battlefield. The clean hit KOs Mario at around 107% on Final Destination. The late hit is hard to land because of up smash's short duration and launches opponents weakly at a horizontal angle. It KOs Mario at around 137% at the edge of Final Destination, and at around 180% at the center of Final Destination."
"714","Fox","Down smash","","14% (feet), 12% (legs)","A split kick. Quick start-up (frame 6) means this move can be used to cover rolls and ledge options and is Fox's most reliable 2-frame punish move. Sends the opponent at a semispike angle. His legs gain intangibility the moment the hitboxes are active (frames 6-7). However, its high endlag makes it punishable if shielded or whiffed. KOs Mario at around 116% and 159% while near the ledge and at the center of Final Destination, respectively."
"715","Fox","Neutral aerial","","9% (clean), 6% (late)","A flying kick. Fox's fastest aerial attack, coming out on frame 4. Due to being a sex kick, it loses power the longer it is out. However, the late hit can be useful for setting up any of his attacks at mid to high percentages, especially due to rather low landing lag (7 frames) coupled with Fox's quick falling speed and it can be relatively safe on shield if spaced properly. A great combo & pressure tool that all Fox mains would be wise to take advantage of. Auto-cancels from a full hop. Third strongest aerial when clean hit, albeit it only starts KOing Mario near the ledge of Final Destination at around 169%."
"716","Fox","Forward aerial","Tornado Kick","1.7% (hit 1), 1.2% (hit 2), 1.7% (hit 3), 2.7% (hit 4), 4.8% (hit 5); 2% (landing hit)","Five swiveling roundhouse kicks performed in quick succession. Comes out on frame 7. This move makes Fox ""hover"" until the move ends if used right after a jump. Good for building up damage, as opponents will be trapped within the flurry of kicks for the duration of the attack. Suffers from moderate landing lag (18 frames), but auto-cancels from a full hop. When fast-fallen, hitting an opponent with any of the first four kicks will drag them towards the ground, allowing for Fox to combo into any of his tilts and smashes upon jab-locking. It can function as a pseudo meteor smash when fast-falling offstage with the opponent before the final hit, allowing him to gimp some opponents who have used their midair jump and can even possibly lead into the Reflector, making the opponent even harder to to recover, but it also puts Fox at higher risk for recovering back to the stage. It can also be used as a situational KOing option while near the upper blast zone at very high percentages."
"717","Fox","Back aerial","","13%","A back kick. A good KO option at very high percentages due to decent startup (9 frames) low landing lag (9 frames), semispike angle, and somewhat high knockback. It has great auto-cancel window (frame 18), allowing Fox to use back aerial at the peak of short hop and fast fall while still auto-canceling before landing, making it a good pressure and spacing option and is relatively safe on shield if hit with the tip of the move, making the move somewhat hard to punish. Also great for catching horizontal recovery options, but it leaves Fox vulnerable offstage due to very high endlag and Fox's high falling speed. It also has a small hitbox and is angled high, making it somewhat hard to land. Fox can combo out of back air at low percentages. KOs Mario at the ledge of Final Destination at around 118%, and around 155% at the center of Final Destination."
"718","Fox","Up aerial","McCloud Flip","5% (hit 1), 10% (hit 2)","From a midair somersault, Fox attacks above him with a tail sweep followed by a heel kick. Comes out on frame 9. Can combo into itself and is great for juggling opponents while racking up quick damage. If hit with the tip of the first hit, there's a chance that the second hit will miss. While it can auto-cancel from a short hop, it can only be done on the first frame Fox jumps after a jumpsquat. Due to lower landing lag (13 frames) compared to Smash 4 and first hit of up aerial having a set knockback, landing only the first hit on the grounded opponent can lead into other moves at any percentage, most notably up smash. Fox's strongest aerial in terms of knockback, and can KO Mario at his full jump height at around 125% and can even KO Mario on the ground starting at 143% on Final Destination, if both hits connect in both cases."
"719","Fox","Down aerial","","1.3% (hits 1-6), 3% (hit 7); 1% (landing)","A drill kick that hits multiple times in quick succession. Auto-cancels from a full hop, and has a good startup (frame 5), making it useful for reading jumps and for getting Fox from the ledge back on stage. The last hit deals low knockback. While it has high landing lag (17 frames), it can be used as a mix-up in case the opponent expects and wants to perfect shield the neutral aerial, or to shield poke. There's a chance the opponent will fall out of this move. The landing hit launches opponents away and at high percentages, a running up smash can be used as an immediate follow-up."
"720","Fox","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his right arm. Has quick startup (frame 6), but has low range and moderate endlag."
"721","Fox","Pummel","","1%","A knee strike. Very fast, but also weak."
"722","Fox","Forward throw","","4% (hit), 3% (throw)","Releases the opponent and quickly performs a cross, launching them forward. Can be used for tech chasing at mid percentages or putting the opponents offstage. Fox's strongest throw, but fails to KO Mario until around 212% at the very edge of Final Destination."
"723","Fox","Back throw","","2% (throw), 2% (Blaster shots)","Throws the opponent backward and shoots them with three rapid shots from his Blaster. Due to high angle and very weak knockback, it's not great at putting the opponents offstage. It can be used to set up tech chase on platforms at various percentages."
"724","Fox","Up throw","","2% (throw), 2% (Blaster shots)","Throws the opponent upward and shoots them with three rapid shots from his Blaster. Can be used to put the opponent on the platform or to follow up with up air if the opponent's reaction is read properly. Has weak knockback as it only starts KOing Mario at around 294% on Final Destination."
"725","Fox","Down throw","","2% (Blaster shots), 1% (throw)","Slams the opponent onto the ground and fires three rapid, point-blank shots at them with his Blaster. Less reliable as a combo starter compared to Smash 4 due to the changes of knockback, angle and hitstun and Fox's slower initial dash speed. Can follow up with an up smash, back air, neutral air, or forward air at low-mid percents depending on opponent's DI and / or if the opponent's reaction is read properly."
"726","Fox","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Does a kick in front and in back."
"727","Fox","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Punches forward and kicks backward."
"728","Fox","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Spins around, kicking around himself."
"729","Fox","Edge attack","","9%","Fox climbs up the ledge and does a sliding dropkick. Afterwards, he retreats with a single-armed back handspring."
"730","Fox","Neutral special","Blaster","3% (point-blank range), 2% (mid range), 1.3% (long range)","Takes his Blaster out of its holster and fires at the opponent. The Blaster itself has relatively low endlag and projectiles have the transcendent priority which makes it good at forcing the approaches at long distances. The Blaster's lasers are fired rapidly, but do not make the opponent flinch and they lose power the farther they travel. Slightly less lag while used in the air. Can be used for camping and is an excellent move for punishing shield breaks or very laggy moves (like Rest) because of the lack of hitstun."
"731","Fox","Side special","Fox Illusion","8% (grounded version), 5% (aerial version)","Dashes forward at a blindingly fast speed, leaving behind afterimages. Fox will launch opponents at an upwards angle on contact. Can be used as a situational recovery option. Stops on shields, making it punishable. The end of the grounded version can function as a KO setup into his up aerial at around 100% on middleweights. The grounded version can also function as a situational KOing move, KOing Mario at around 174% on Final Destination."
"732","Fox","Up special","Fire Fox","1.8% (charge loop), 16% (clean dash), 10% (late dash)","Engulfs himself in an aura of flame before launching himself in a fiery tackle. Since this move is fire-based, it can detonate some items like Links' bombs. Travels a long distance, but has very high startup for both his charging flames and dash (20 and 43 frames, respectively), in addition to it being completely linear making Fox widely open for edgeguards. The trajectory of the move can be chosen before Fox launches himself, with up to 8 angles to choose from. After the move ends, Fox becomes helpless. Can be used to kill at high percents, however, this is risky due to the high end lag. It can also stage spike reckless edgeguarders who got hit with Fire Fox."
"733","Fox","Down special","Reflector","2% (activation), 1.4× reflected projectile","Activates his Reflector, surrounding himself with a blue hexagonal energy field. All projectiles are deflected and do increased damage. The Reflector also damages nearby foes upon activation, weakly launching them at a semispike angle. After reflecting a projectile, Fox can jump, spotdodge or roll, which allows him to escape potential punishes. It stalls Fox in the air, giving him a landing or a recovery mix-up, though he can only do it once until he lands or gets hit. Due to 3 frame startup, intangibility on frames 2-3 and low knockback angle, this move can be used to finish combos, start tech chases, escape combos, and edgeguard or gimp recoveries."
"734","Fox","Final Smash","Team Star Fox","3% (trapping hit), 30% (lasers), 10% (end)","Upon activation, Fox shouts ""It's go time!"", with a large green reticle appearing in front of him. Three Arwings fly in a tight formation from behind the screen in the area where the reticle is located. Upon hit, a cinematic begins with Fox and his team flying in a group of Arwings, as Fox himself says, ""Star Fox- fire at will!"" (saying ""This is the end for you, Wolf!"" if he hits Wolf), as all of the members then fire lasers at the trapped opponents, damaging them heavily and launching them horizontally as the cutscene ends."
"735","Falco","Neutral attack","","1.5%","Performs two knifehanded strikes before spinning his whole body to perform a series of knifehand strikes, with a final downward axe kick that sends the opponent away. The first two jabs can lock. The first hit starts on frame 2, making it one of the fastest neutral attacks in the game. At mid percents, it can be followed up with Blaster to lock opponents who miss a tech. As Falco's neutral attack will only transition into an infinite and has high ending lag if canceled on the second hit, it can be punishable on shield. Regardless, its speed makes it a reliable close-range interceptor."
"736","Falco","Neutral attack","","1.5%","Performs two knifehanded strikes before spinning his whole body to perform a series of knifehand strikes, with a final downward axe kick that sends the opponent away.

"737","Falco","Neutral attack","","0.3% (loop), 3% (last)","Performs two knifehanded strikes before spinning his whole body to perform a series of knifehand strikes, with a final downward axe kick that sends the opponent away. The first two jabs can lock. The first hit starts on frame 2, making it one of the fastest neutral attacks in the game. At mid percents, it can be followed up with Blaster to lock opponents who miss a tech. As Falco's neutral attack will only transition into an infinite and has high ending lag if canceled on the second hit, it can be punishable on shield. Regardless, its speed makes it a reliable close-range interceptor."
"738","Falco","Forward tilt","","6%","A roundhouse kick that can be angled both up and down. The angled versions send Falco's leg at very strong angles, being capable of missing medium-sized characters like Mario if aimed up, but being able to hit any grounded character when aimed down. It is fast (frame 6) and has rather low ending lag (19 frames), but will not cause tumbling until around 70%, making more suited for creating space at lower percents. At higher percents, it can set up a tech-chase situation."
"739","Falco","Up tilt","","3.5% (hit 1), 2.7% (hit 1 sourspot), 4% (hit 2)","Swings his wings up in the air, one after the other. Very fast (frame 5) with wide hitboxes that can hit prone opponents in front, and medium-sized characters from behind. One of Falco's best combo initiators due to its speed, low ending lag and low knockback, allowing him to follow up with his capable aerial moves. It can combo into itself or neutral aerial at low percents, most aerials at mid percents, and even up aerial at around 110% as a KO setup. Hit 1 has a sourspot near the end of its hitbox duration that deals 2.7%, and has set knockback with no followups."
"740","Falco","Down tilt","Tail Cutter","13% (near), 12% (mid), 10.5% (far)","Crouches on the floor and swipes with his tail feathers. A very strong down tilt with high damage and knockback, though it is rather slow (frame 10). Deals more damage and knockback the closer the opponent is to Falco, with the sweetspot being capable of KOing Mario at around 128%, and the sourspots being able to start aerial combos."
"741","Falco","Dash attack","","9% (clean), 6% (late)","A flying kick. Has decent knockback and is a usable approach option due to its speed (frame 8) and the distance Falco moves. The clean hit sends at a diagonal trajectory, while the late hit sends at a semi-spike angle. However, it is punishable on shield and cannot KO until extremely high percentages."
"742","Falco","Forward smash","","16% (clean), 12% (late)","Uses both wings to perform a wide knifehanded swing in front of himself. Hits on frame 17. Unlike the version in SSB4, Falco does not move forward as much, reducing its range. Regardless, the clean hit is one of Falco's strongest finishers, KOing Mario at 100% from the middle of Final Destination. The late hit sends at a semi-spike angle and still has respectable KO potential near the ledge, doing so at around 130%."
"743","Falco","Up smash","","4% (hit 1), 13% (hit 2)","Performs a 540 kick while facing towards/away from the camera (the former if he is facing right). Very fast for a smash attack, hitting on frame 7. However, its hitbox has been moved significantly upwards, heavily reducing its utility from SSB4 as it will now completely miss medium-sized opponents touching his back, opponents one character length away from him, and even fully prone opponents directly next to Falco's legs. As a result, it is mostly used to punish landings from above Falco, and can no longer be used as an all-purpose smash attack, Furthermore, up smash is known to occasionally fail in the conversion from the first hit to the second, which weakens it as a finishing move.  The second hit KOs Mario at 117%."
"744","Falco","Down smash","","15% (feet), 12% (legs)","A split kick. Falco's feet are intangible during the attack. Comes out fast (frame 8) and sends at a semi-spike angle with reasonable knockback, making it effective against fighters with poor horizontal recovery. However, its range is extremely lacking, with both his forward and down tilts outranging it. KOs Mario at 104% from the edge of Final Destination. It has a sourspot on Falco's legs, though this is very hard to land due to the sweetspot outprioritizing it."
"745","Falco","Neutral aerial","Spinning Falco Chop","3% (hits 1), 2% (hit 2-3), 4% (hit 4)","Spins his entire body clockwise to perform a series of spinning knifehanded strikes. Despite its looks, it has difficulty hitting opponents from behind. Extremely fast startup (frame 3) with low landing lag (9 frames), hitboxes that cover most of his upper body, and a good damage output. It is an overall effective move for aerial offense, as it can be used out of a short hop as a walling option, follow up into other moves, catch opponents out of shield, and KO offstage at around 90%. The looping hits use the autolink angle, allowing it to start combos while falling; however, the hits now transition faster, making this difficult to do consistently. Opponents may also fall out of the move if Falco fast-falls. Auto-cancels from a full hop fast-fall, though the timing is rather strict."
"746","Falco","Forward aerial","","1% (hits 1-5), 4% (hit 6), 3% (landing hit)","Spins in a drill-like formation, hitting multiple times with his beak. It is relatively fast (frame 7) with a further-reaching hitbox than neutral aerial. The hits use the auto-link angle and therefore connect reliably, and can be used to gimp recovering opponents while falling; trading hits with forward aerial usually results in the opponent being sent diagonally downwards. The final hit deals decent knockback and can KO at 135% near the edge. This move has rather high landing lag (15 frames) and cannot auto-cancel; instead, landing causes a grounded hit in front of Falco which deals moderate knockback. This makes it safer on shield, and can KO at the edge of the stage from 154%."
"747","Falco","Back aerial","","13% (clean), 7% (late)","Faces backwards to perform a kick behind himself. Its renowned power from SSB4 has been retained, being one of the strongest back aerials in the game. This makes it Falco's best aerial KO option, doing so on Mario at 85% at the edge of Final Destination. However, its utility has been toned back due to an increase of startup lag, now making its speed rather average (frame 9) and makes it more difficult to hit most characters out of a short hop. Back aerial is also a sex kick, allowing it to wall out opponents while landing. Auto-cancels from a short hop."
"748","Falco","Up aerial","","9%","A somersault kick from back to front above himself. Sends at a slightly diagonal trajectory upwards. Hits on frame 7, auto-cancels from a short hop, has low landing lag (9 frames) and possesses a deceptively wide hitbox which can catch opponents if used right before landing. These factors make it an excellent aerial juggling tool, as it can knock opponents into the air for additional followups, including into itself. Due to Falco's impressive jump height, it can act as a KO option at around 130% near the upper blast line. However, it will not hit medium-sized characters during a short hop unless Falco directly touches his foe."
"749","Falco","Down aerial","Corkscrew Meteor","13% (clean), 8% (late)","A downward corkscrew kick that hits once. Has sex kick properties, with the clean hit dealing a powerful diagonal meteor smash against aerial opponents. Previously infamous for being heavily nerfed from Brawl to SSB4, down aerial has been significantly buffed in Ultimate: it now auto-cancels in a short hop and has twice the startup of the iteration in Brawl (frame 10). As a result, it is an excellent tool in the neutral game, allowing Falco to put out a lasting hitbox with little risk of punishment. It is also a potent edgeguarding tool due to the meteor smash's sheer speed. On grounded opponents, the move instead launches them directly upward at a slight angle with higher base knockback but much lower knockback scaling, granting it combo potential at a wide variety of percents, including into a second down aerial as a KO combo. However, the move has notably high ending lag, noticeable landing lag (14 frames) and very poor horizontal range. Regardless of these factors, down aerial is once again one of Falco's staple moves."
"750","Falco","Grab","","—","Reaches forward with his right wing. A fast grab."
"751","Falco","Pummel","","1.2%","Knees the opponent. Rather slow for a pummel."
"752","Falco","Forward throw","","4% (hit), 3% (throw)","Slams the opponent forward with his right arm. Has no true followups at 0%, though it can followup with dash attack. At around 40%, it causes opponents to tumble, allowing setups such as a lock from neutral attack or Blaster, or tech chases if the opponent rolls. Otherwise, this throw is mostly used to send opponents offstage."
"753","Falco","Back throw","","6% (throw), 3% (Blaster shot)","Throws the opponent behind him before firing a Blaster shot towards them. The laser can KO at extremely high percentages near the edge, though opponents can DI'd out of it. It is otherwise used to send opponents offstage, like forward throw."
"754","Falco","Up throw","","4% (throw), 4% (Blaster shot)","Throws the opponent above him before firing a Blaster shot towards them. An effective aerial combo initiator, as it can combo into aerials from 0% till as high as 120% if the laser connects. At high percents, up aerial can KO an opponent after an up throw. However, opponents can DI away from the laser, much like back throw."
"755","Falco","Down throw","","2% (throw), 3% (Blaster shot)","Lays the opponent on the ground before firing a point blank Blaster shot. It is an effective combo throw like up throw, though it is more focused on grounded followups. Combos into neutral attack, dash attack, forward tilt, up smash, neutral aerial, forward aerial, Blaster, and Falco Phantasm. Can also set up for Blaster locks."
"756","Falco","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Gets up and does a thrust kick behind him with one leg, and then in front of him with the other."
"757","Falco","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Similar to his frontal floor attack, but he kicks in front of himself first."
"758","Falco","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Does a sweep kick forward, then backwards."
"759","Falco","Edge attack","","9%","Lifts his entire body onto the stage to attack with a corkscrewing dropkick, before returning onto his feet from a back handspring."
"760","Falco","Neutral special","Blaster","3%","Pulls out his Blaster and fires a slim blue laser projectile. Compared to Fox's Blaster, it fires at a much slower rate but causes hitstun and deals electric damage. It is very laggy on the ground, making it very punishable if the opponent is close or at a low percentage. However, it is much more effective in the air, as it can be fired marginally faster while airborne and has significantly lower ending lag, with short hop Blaster shots causing Falco to experience only 6 frames of landing lag. This is one of Falco's main tools with multiple uses, including deterring approaches, gimping offstage opponents, tacking on damage, and locking failed techs."
"761","Falco","Side special","Falco Phantasm","7% (grounded), 6% (aerial)","Rears back before launching himself forward in a blue blur of afterimages. The grounded move will stop if Falco reaches a ledge. Compared to Fox Illusion, Falco Phantasm starts up faster and deals less knockback when grounded, but will weakly meteor smash aerial opponents, allowing it to be used for gimps. As the grounded version moves opponents slightly towards Falco, it can be used to initiate combos. It is also an excellent horizontal recovery option, as it does not cause helplessness. However, it can only be used once in midair before landing, will cause Falco to stop in front of a shielding opponent, and has a predictable trajectory. As a result, it is easily punishable if used carelessly. Despite its looks, the hitbox stops short near the end of the move when Falco begins to slow down. After concluding the dash, Falco does a cancellable animation where he fist pumps both his arms towards his sides."
"762","Falco","Up special","Fire Bird","2% (charging loop), 3% (tackle startup), 2% (tackle loop)","Engulfs himself in an aura of flame before launching himself in a fiery tackle. The trajectory of the move can be chosen before Falco launches himself, with up to 16 angles to choose from. After the move ends, Falco becomes helpless. Compared to Fire Fox, Fire Bird travels less distance, deals multiple hits and has almost no KO potential, though it does a high amount of total damage if every hit lands (does a maximum of 33%, being the most damaging up special in the game). It can therefore be used as a niche damage-racking option, though the looping hits sometimes have issues keeping the opponent trapped in the move."
"763","Falco","Down special","Reflector","5% (Reflector), 1.2× reflected projectile","Activates his Reflector and kicks it forward, reflecting any projectiles back towards opponents and doing minimal electric damage to opponents that make contact. It then returns to him as if it was magnetized. It can also be used as a poking tool that can lock floored opponents."
"764","Falco","Final Smash","Team Star Fox","3% (trapping hit), 30% (Arwings), 10% (end)","Upon activation, Falco announces ""Showtime!"" and targets in front of himself with a green reticle. Three Arwings fly in an unorthodox formation from behind the screen in the area where the reticle is located. Upon hit, both Falco and his victims are sent skywards, and a cinematic begins with Falco and his team flying in a group of Arwings. Falco then announces ""Time for a little payback!"" (single victim), or ""We've got multiple bogeys inbound!"" (multiple targets), as all of the members then fire lasers at the trapped opponents, damaging them heavily. Compared to Fox's version, Falco's Arwing flight has a more erratic flight pattern, and the launching hit causes vertical knockback."
"765","Wolf","Neutral attack","","2%","An inward slash with his left hand, followed by another inward slash with his right, finishing with an outward swipe with the right. Fairly quick, coming out on frame 4, and can jab lock opponents. However, the last hit has short range compared to other neutral attacks, which can cause it to fail to connect from the previous hits at high percents."
"766","Wolf","Neutral attack","","2%","An inward slash with his left hand, followed by another inward slash with his right, finishing with an outward swipe with the right. Fairly quick, coming out on frame 4, and can jab lock opponents. However, the last hit has short range compared to other neutral attacks, which can cause it to fail to connect from the previous hits at high percents."

Fairly quick, coming out on frame 4, and can jab lock opponents. However, the last hit has short range compared to other neutral attacks, which can cause it to fail to connect from the previous hits at high percents."
"768","Wolf","Forward tilt","","5% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Forcefully brings his claws together, then separates his claws on impact. The first hit produces a large amount of freeze frames. Deals above-average damage for a tilt, and can KO at around 140% near the edge of Final Destination."
"769","Wolf","Up tilt","","10% (foot), 9% (leg), 8% (body)","A leaping upward kick with one leg. It has fast startup, and high power when hitting with the sweetspot at Wolf's foot, KOing middleweights under 140% from ground level. However, unlike most other up tilts, its ending lag and launch angle prevents it from being used to start combos."
"770","Wolf","Down tilt","","6%","Kicks out with his foot while crouching. The move has rather decent range and quick speed, which makes it a good poking and pressuring option, as well as a useful tool to deny approaches. It also has the chance to trip, which can potentially make it a combo starter. However, it is the weakest out of Wolf's tilts."
"771","Wolf","Dash attack","","11% (clean), 8% (late)","Lunges forward with a flying kick. Has decent startup, but most importantly, it propels Wolf forward a considerable distance, and its clean hit deals respectable damage and knockback. This allows it to function as a reliable burst option to punish landings, whiffed moves, and follow up from other attacks. Hitting opponents close to Wolf launches them upward, while hitting them near his foot launches them more horizontally. Depending on which hitbox is landed, the clean hit can KO under 150% from center stage, and under 120% near the edge."
"772","Wolf","Forward smash","","15%","Rears back, then performs a forceful palm strike. While it has slow startup, hitting on frame 20, it has notoriously low ending lag (interruptible on frame 42), allowing it to be safe on shield, and potentially difficult to punish even if missed. It also has remarkable power, KOing middleweights at around 100% from center stage. As a result, it is one of Wolf's safest KO options on the ground."
"773","Wolf","Up smash","","6% (hit 1), 12% (hit 2)","A breakdance-like spin followed by an upward dropkick. It has the fastest start-up of his smash attacks. The first hit offers surprisingly long horizontal range, which when combined with its moderately fast startup, makes it a great out-of-shield option. It deals high damage, hits at both sides and provides wide coverage above Wolf, making it useful to quickly punish opponents close to him and set up juggles. Due to its moderate ending lag for an up smash, the second hit can also lead into an up aerial at low percents if the opponent's option out of hitstun is successfully covered. However, its power is slightly below-average for a smash attack, not KOing middleweights until around 120% uncharged, and can be easily punished on shield due to the second hit's lack of horizontal range."
"774","Wolf","Down smash","","14%/16% (hit 1), 12%/14% (hit 2)","Slashes at a low height in front of himself with one hand, then behind himself with the same hand. Both hits have sweetspots at the tips of Wolf's claws, which launch at a lower, semi-spike angle with higher power. The move has moderate startup (hitting on frame 14 at the front), but has decent ending lag for a smash attack (interruptible on frame 44), making it safe on shield if spaced, can reliably 2 frame punish opponents, and the sweetspots are extremely powerful, with the front hit's sweetspot being among the strongest down smashes in the game and KOing middleweights from center stage at around 85%, and the back one at around 100%, and both KOing them near edges at around 55% and 70% respectively. As a result, it is Wolf's most dangerous edgeguard tool, as well as a reliable finisher at close range."
"775","Wolf","Neutral aerial","","12% (clean), 8% (late)","A flying kick, much like Fox's neutral aerial. Compared to other sex kick neutral aerials, it has slower startup (hitting on frame 7), but deals higher damage and knockback with its clean hit. It is one of Wolf's fastest aerials, tied with his forward and up aerials, but compared to those, it hits lower, has a longer duration, and covers a consistent area. Combined with its low landing lag (9 frames), this makes it very useful for air-to-ground transitioning, as well as starting combos at a variety of percents, with the clean hit being more effective at lower percents and the late hit being more effective at higher percents. The clean hit is also a decent finisher near the edge, KOing at around 145%."
"776","Wolf","Forward aerial","","9%","A downward arcing slash with his left arm. It is a staple of Wolf's neutral game, with its fast startup (tied with neutral and up aerial), wide vertical arc, and low landing lag (10 frames) making it a safe approach option, and combined with its 60° launch angle, allowing it to combo into a multitude of moves, such as a jab, any tilt, or grab at low percents, any aerial attack from low to mid percents (including itself to extend combos), and even Wolf Flash as a KO setup (albeit risky and hard to land) at high percents. However, it has poor edgeguarding ability due to its more vertical angle, and deals the least damage and knockback out of Wolf's aerials, exacerbated further by stale-move negation due to its frequent use in his neutral game."
"777","Wolf","Back aerial","","11% (body), 13% (leg), 15% (foot)","A back kick. It has noticeable startup (hitting on frame 13), ending lag, and landing lag (15 frames), making it Wolf's second slowest aerial (behind down aerial). To compensate, its autocancel frames come out very quickly after the hitboxes (on frame 18), effectively giving it little to no ending lag with proper timing, allowing it to poke shields and bait opponents. It is also one of Wolf's main KO moves: it deals high damage and significant knockback if sweetspotted, KOing at around 110% from center stage and 75% near the edge, while its other hitboxes still boast respectable KO potential."
"778","Wolf","Up aerial","","12%","An overhead arcing slash, starting from the front. Its fast startup, wide arc, low landing lag (10 frames) and vertical knockback allow it to juggle opponents very effectively. It can also set up combos into itself and other attacks from low to mid percents, though not as reliably as forward aerial. Additionally, it possesses enough knockback to KO from 120% to 130% near the top blast line."
"779","Wolf","Down aerial","","13% (body), 15% (arms)","A takedown slash below himself with both arms. It has the most startup (hitting on frame 16), ending lag, and landing lag (19 frames) out of Wolf's aerials, making it particularly risky to use offstage due to Wolf's poor recovery. However, it meteor smashes opponents consistently throughout the move, instead of requiring to land a specific part of it like most other meteor smashing aerials. This essentially turns it into a high risk, high reward edgeguarding option. Against grounded opponents, it can combo into a variety of attacks even up to high percents."
"780","Wolf","Grab","","—","Swipes forward with his right arm."
"781","Wolf","Pummel","","1.3%","Hits the opponent with his right knee."
"782","Wolf","Forward throw","","5% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Slashes the opponent away. While it deals decent damage, it is extremely weak, not KOing opponents under 300% even at the edge, and its ending lag is too high for reliable followups. Because of this, it has little utility outside of throwing opponents offstage. Even then, it is mostly outclassed by down throw for said purpose, which also launches horizontally, but deals considerably higher knockback and has combos at lower percents, with forward throw's only advantages over it being its slightly higher damage and lower angle. However, the lower angle makes it a rather potent tech-chasing move at higher percentages."
"783","Wolf","Back throw","","6% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Sets the opponent behind himself and launches them away with an ascending slash. Deals the most damage out of Wolf's throws, and has remarkable knockback, allowing it to KO middleweights at around 185% from center stage, and around 130% near the edge. However, its launching angle is mostly diagonal, making it somewhat easy to DI."
"784","Wolf","Up throw","","5% (hit 1), 2% (throw)","Brings the opponent above himself and slashes them upward. One of Wolf's most reliable combo starters, leading into a forward aerial or up aerial until around 90%, which can then keep the opponent in a disadvantageous state."
"785","Wolf","Down throw","","8.5%","Grabs the opponent by the head, then does a leaping somersault and slams them onto the ground. It launches opponents horizontally with low ending lag, allowing it to combo into a dash attack until around 45%, or potentially set up tech-chases if the opponent does not DI enough to act out of hitstun before hitting the ground. At around the 60-100% percent range, it can also combo into Wolf Flash depending on weight and DI, though doing this close to an edge will cause Wolf to self-destruct in the process, making it a high-risk, high-reward combo."
"786","Wolf","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Gets up and kicks backward, then forward."
"787","Wolf","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Gets up and punches forward, then kicks backward."
"788","Wolf","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Sweeps one leg around himself, starting from the front."
"789","Wolf","Edge attack","","9%","Gets up and slashes inward."
"790","Wolf","Neutral special","Blaster","7% (bayonet), 6%/8%/7% (laser close-far)","Fires a single, purple energy shot from his blaster. This move is the centerpiece of Wolf's neutral game and is widely considered to be one of the best projectiles in the game. It has the ability to be able to reliably disrupt and force approaches thanks to its decent lag, as well as the laser's moderately large size and transcendent priority. Unlike most projectiles, it has great utility in close-quarters combat, as the blaster itself has a hitbox on the bayonet which connects to the laser, dealing decent damage if both hits connect. As a result, it is an excellent tool in Wolf's neutral game, due to the myriad of abilities it is capable of."
"791","Wolf","Side special","Wolf Flash","3% (dash), 20% (meteor smash), 15% (semi-spike)","Dashes quickly at a diagonal angle, leaving a claw trail behind, alongside another trail in front of himself at the end of the dash. It can be slightly aimed up or down, the latter which allows it to hit most grounded opponents. The dash itself is very weak, but at the end, it possesses two, much stronger hitboxes; one closer to Wolf's center that meteor smashes aerial opponents, and another more in front of him that semi-spikes both grounded and aerial ones. The meteor hitbox deals extremely high damage with enough knockback to KO opponents at around 10% at ground level, while the semi-spike can KO at around 120% from center stage and 85% near edges; as a result, it is one of Wolf's strongest finishers. However, it causes helplessness, and has high landing lag of 30 frames, making it very risky to use, and requiring Wolf to pick between it or Fire Wolf for recovery."
"792","Wolf","Up special","Fire Wolf","4% (hit 1), 2.5% (hits 2-4), 5% (hit 5, ground), 6% (hit 5, air)","Propels himself with a kick in the chosen direction, dragging opponents along in multiple hits, then delivers a final kick with his other leg. It is generally subpar as a recovery option, due to its slow startup and lack of distance compared to other recoveries that can be aimed. However, it works decently as an attack, as it deals high damage if all hits connect, and the last hit can KO at around 150% from center stage, and 95% at the edge, which makes it a potent edgeguarding tool if used correctly."
"793","Wolf","Down special","Reflector","4% (startup), 5% (reflection), 1.5× damage (reflected projectiles)","Activates his reflecting device, creating an electrical field around himself that reflects incoming projectiles. Reflected projectiles deal more damage and travel at almost twice the original speed. Upon activation, the Reflector also grants Wolf brief intangibility (frames 5-8), and damages opponents in addition to launching them at a mostly vertical angle (65°), granting it some combo potential. There's also another hitbox that comes out once Wolf reflects a projectile that deals 5% damage. Unlike Fox's Reflector, Wolf's  version does not stall him upon first use in the air."
"794","Wolf","Final Smash","Team Star Wolf","3% (trapping hit), 35% (lasers), 10% (end)","Upon activation, Wolf shouts ""Wolf pack!"", with a large red reticle appearing in front of him, as a Wolfen flies from behind the screen in the area where the reticle is located. Upon hit, a cinematic begins with Wolf and his crew flying in a group of Wolfens, as Wolf himself says, ""Grahaha! The hunt is on, boys!"" (saying ""I've got you now, Star Fox!"" if he hits Fox or Falco), as all of the members then fire lasers at the trapped opponents, damaging them heavily and launching them horizontally as the cutscene ends."
"795","Pikachu","Neutral attack","Headbutt","1.4% (near), 1.2% (mid), 1% (far)","Quickly headbutts forward. Has minimal startup lag (frame 2) and low cooldown, making it spammable and combo into itself easily. Can lock."
"796","Pikachu","Forward tilt","","10%","An electrified double kick performed from the baby freeze, a variation of the freeze breakdancing move. It deals more damage when angled upward, and the lower angles semi-spike. Deals moderate knockback; the unangled version KOs Mario around 155% at the edge of Final Destination."
"797","Pikachu","Forward tilt","","9%","An electrified double kick performed from the baby freeze, a variation of the freeze breakdancing move. It deals more damage when angled upward, and the lower angles semi-spike. Deals moderate knockback; the unangled version KOs Mario around 155% at the edge of Final Destination."
"798","Pikachu","Forward tilt","","8%","An electrified double kick performed from the baby freeze, a variation of the freeze breakdancing move. It deals more damage when angled upward, and the lower angles semi-spike. Deals moderate knockback; the unangled version KOs Mario around 155% at the edge of Final Destination."
"799","Pikachu","Up tilt","","5%","An overhead tail swipe, starting from behind Pikachu. An excellent combo starter, comboing into itself at low percents and into Pikachu's aerials at low to mid percents. A powerful juggling tool. Has moderate startup lag, however, as it does not hit opponents in front of Pikachu until frames 9-10, depending on their size."
"800","Pikachu","Down tilt","","6%","Lays down and sweeps its tail in front of itself. Has good horizontal reach and very low ending lag, making it somewhat spammable. Can trip at low percents."
"801","Pikachu","Dash attack","Running Headbutt","11% (clean), 6% (late)","A battering ram. The early hitbox deals solid damage and good knockback, allowing it to KO middleweights around 135% on Final Destination. It also has fairly low startup lag (frame 6), and the early hitbox lasts deceptively long. However, the late hitbox has no KO potential at any reasonable percent, and the high ending lag prevents either hit from comboing."
"802","Pikachu","Forward smash","","15% (early), 18% (clean), 12% (late)","Rears its head back before leaning forward and releasing a large orb of electricity in front of it, leaving a trail of electricity. The early hit comes out on frame 15, the clean hit on frame 17 and the late hit on frame 20. The center of the ball deals the most damage and knockback, having high horizontal KO potential. The trail deals the second most damage and the least knockback, and the tip deals the least damage and second most knockback. Has good range, with a hitbox the close to the size of Pikachu. The uncharged sweetspot KOs Mario around 80% at the edge of Final Destination, although the early hit doesn't KO until 105% and the late hit until 100%, giving the attack several sourspots and making it very inconsistent. Also has a long duration and noticeable ending lag, making it very easy to punish if shielded or dodged."
"803","Pikachu","Up smash","","14% (early, body), 13% (early, tail), 11% (clean), 7% (late)","An overhead tail swipe. Unlike Pikachu's up tilt, it starts in front of it and has good vertical KO potential. The early hit comes out somewhat quickly (frame 10) and lasts until Pikachu's tail goes above it, after which the clean hit lasts until the tail goes behind it. The early hit's sweetspot is located on Pikachu's body, and is very difficult to land outside a shield break punish. The early sweetspot KOs middleweights around 115% on Final Destination, while the early sourspot KOs around 125%. The late hit, however, deals minimal damage and knockback."
"804","Pikachu","Down smash","Electric Flower","2% (hits 1-5), 3% (hit 6)","Charges its tail with electricity before spinning it around, shocking opponents. Has the least damage potential out of all its smash attacks, dealing only 13%. It KOs middleweights around 95% at the edge of Final Destination and deals good horizontal knockback. Also has the least start-up out of all its smash attacks, coming out on frame 8, but its 42 frames of ending lag makes it very punishable if used poorly."
"805","Pikachu","Neutral aerial","","1.8% (hits 1-3), 3.5% (hit 4)","Poses while charging itself with electricity, shocking nearby opponents. Hits 4 times. One of Pikachu's most versatile tools; it is useful for breaking out of combos due to its very fast startup (frame 3), can combo into itself offstage at very low percent, can be used to drag down opponents for edgeguarding offstage, or for comboing into jab, up tilt, forward tilt, down tilt, grab, or even up smash. Autocancels in a short hop."
"806","Pikachu","Forward aerial","","1.4% (hits 1-5), 4.8% (hit 6)","Spins its forward with an electrically charged head, shocking opponents. Moderate startup lag at frame 11 and hits 6 times. Has low landing lag, making it an effective spacing option, but has very small looping hitboxes which are very close to Pikachu's head and don't use the autolink angle, thus having terrible range and unlike Pichu's version, the hits don't always connect properly because they don't launch at the autolink angle. The multiple hits and long duration make it an effective aerial for SHFFing."
"807","Pikachu","Back aerial","Glider","1% (hits 1-5), 3.6% (hit 6), 4% (landing)","Spins around horizontally, hitting multiple times, with a pose at the end to launch foes. Very fast, coming out on frame 4 and can hit all around Pikachu, but it's below average knockback doesn't make it reliable for KOing until very high percents and has very short range, only hitting opponents very close to Pikachu. At such it's more useful for combos. Can drag down opponents, and has a landing hitbox. It has 18 frames of landing lag, however."
"808","Pikachu","Up aerial","","6% (clean, tail), 5% (clean, tip), 4% (late)","An overhead tail swipe, starting from behind Pikachu. A good combo starter, comboing into itself and other aerials at low percents. Has low horizontal knockback."
"809","Pikachu","Down aerial","Electric Screw","13% (clean), 12% (late), 4% (landing)","Points down and spins its head downwards, launching opponents. The clean hit is a powerful meteor smash, while the late hit has good horizontal knockback. Has a landing hitbox. However it has 22 frames of landing lag."
"810","Pikachu","Grab","","—","Reaches out. Pikachu will have a scared look if it misses. Pikachu's grab is fast, but has low range."
"811","Pikachu","Pummel","","1%","Headbutts the opponent, shocking them with electricity."
"812","Pikachu","Forward throw","","2% (hits 1-5)","Lays the opponent on its tail and shocks them. It's Pikachu's most damaging throw, but is too weak to KO and not fit for combos either, thus having  little utility outside its high damage output."
"813","Pikachu","Back throw","","9%","Rolls backwards before launching the opponent with a tomoe nage, a throw used in judo. Very good for setting up edgeguards, as it has high base knockback and the animation means opponents near the center will end up being launched near the edge, but it is unimpressive as a KOing option as it only starts KOing middleweights around 165% at the edge of Final Destination."
"814","Pikachu","Up throw","","3% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Heaves the opponent onto its head and headbutts it upwards. A good low percent combo throw. Has decent knockback growth, making it Pikachu's best KOing throw. However, its KO setup with Thunder is less consistent due to its higher knockback."
"815","Pikachu","Down throw","","5%","Lays the opponent on the ground and performs a senton. A good combo starter comboing into every aerial except down aerial reliably from low to mid percent, allowing Pikachu to start chains."
"816","Pikachu","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Spins its tail around itself while getting up."
"817","Pikachu","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Spins its tail around itself while getting up."
"818","Pikachu","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Spins its tail around itself while getting up."
"819","Pikachu","Edge attack","","9%","Swings its tail in an overhead arcing motion while climbing up."
"820","Pikachu","Neutral special","Thunder Jolt","6% (clean), 5% (mid), 4% (late), 4.8% (aerial)","Shoots a ball of electricity. A very useful projectile, as it deals good damage, moves quickly, and can be used repeatedly. When it goes over the edge, it sticks to the platform it's on, looping around until its lifespan is over or it hits the bottom of a soft platform. This property allows it to be used to annoy opponents trying to recover by using it near the edge and hitting them when they attempt to grab it."
"821","Pikachu","Side special","Skull Bash","6.2% (uncharged), 10% (uncharged smash input), 21.4% (fully charged)","Charges up before launching forward at a high velocity. Can be charged to increased damage, knockback, and distance. Useful for horizontal recovery, as it has a hitbox protecting it, high horizontal distance, and can sweetspot the ledge. Can also be used to punish shield breaks due to its high knockback when charged; however, it has high ending lag. If inputted like a smash attack, it immediately starts with some charge."
"822","Pikachu","Up special","Quick Attack","2% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2)","Zips upward at high speeds, dealing damage to opponents on contact. Can be angled; if angled in a different direction after the first time it is used, Pikachu will use it again. It covers great distance and can be unpredictable if used well, but it leaves Pikachu helpless. It's also an approach option, however in this case it can be predictable and it is unsafe on shield. Pikachu also cannot use the Quick Attack canceling tecnique anymore."
"823","Pikachu","Down special","Thunder","15% (shockwave), 8% (thunderbolt), 6% (thunderbolt meteor)","Calls down a bolt of lightning from the sky. If the bolt strikes Pikachu, it will create an electric explosion around itself, dealing massive knockback and granting Pikachu intangibility for 10 frames. If an opponent is struck near the top of the bolt, they're launched down into Pikachu; otherwise, they're launched upwards. Has high endlag if the bolt doesn't strike Pikachu. The thunderbolt becomes active on frame 13, but there is a long gap before the discharge, and thus, it's easy to attack Pikachu before the thunderbolt hits it and is very vulnerable to counters."
"824","Pikachu","Final Smash","Volt Tackle","0.3% (6 hits during startup), 1% (initial hit), 1.5% (loop), 20% (launch)","Surrounds itself with electricity before dashing forwards. If it connects, Pikachu will barrage the opponents caught with repeated strikes in this form before launching them."
"825","Jigglypuff","Neutral attack","","3%","Jigglypuff performs two alternating punches. Both hits can lock, but the second hit will fail at percentages greater than 3%."
"826","Jigglypuff","Neutral attack","","3%","Jigglypuff performs two alternating punches. Both hits can lock, but the second hit will fail at percentages greater than 3%."
"827","Jigglypuff","Forward tilt","","10%","A roundhouse kick. It can be angled, and can lock at low percents."
"828","Jigglypuff","Up tilt","","9% (clean), 8% (late)","A scorpion kick. Unless the opponent has a tall hurtbox, this move will fail to hit anyone in front of Jigglypuff. Can combo into itself or an up aerial at low percents."
"829","Jigglypuff","Down tilt","","10%","A crouching shin kick. Launches opponents at a semi-spike angle, making it a good tool for spacing."
"830","Jigglypuff","Dash attack","Jiggly Ram","12% (clean), 8% (late)","Leaps off the ground and attacks with a lunging headbutt."
"831","Jigglypuff","Forward smash","","16% (clean), 14% (late)","Holds its foot behind itself and then attacks with a lunging roundhouse kick. Can lock at low percentages."
"832","Jigglypuff","Up smash","","15%","An upwards headbutt."
"833","Jigglypuff","Down smash","Jiggly Split","11%","A spinning split kick. Grants intangibility on Jigglypuff's feet (frames 10-12). Opponents with high damage are launched at a higher angle."
"834","Jigglypuff","Neutral aerial","","11% (clean), 6% (late)","A flying kick. It is a sex kick with a long-lasting late hitbox. One of Jigglypuff's best moves, as it is very safe and has decent knockback when sweetspotted. Commonly used to block opponents from reaching the edge."
"835","Jigglypuff","Forward aerial","","9% (clean), 6% (late)","A dropkick. Somewhat weak knockback, but good for spacing. Has a lingering hitbox (though it does not as last as long as neutral aerial's hitbox), while its late hitbox can combo into Rest. Autocancels, but only if quickly inputted after a short hop."
"836","Jigglypuff","Back aerial","","13%","A spinning back kick. This causes Jigglypuff to turn around, similar to Marth's back aerial. This move is Jigglypuff's slowest aerial, and it lacks a lingering hitbox unlike its other aerials, but has strong knockback and good range while still being reasonably quick, making it a potent finisher."
"837","Jigglypuff","Up aerial","","9%","Waves its arm in an overhead arcing motion. Good for juggling, and can be used to initiate combos if it hits an opponent just before Jigglypuff lands."
"838","Jigglypuff","Down aerial","","1.5% (hits 1-8), 2% (hit 9)","A diagonal corkscrew dropkick. Good out of shield option and somewhat effective as an anti-juggling option. It is slightly less unsafe than in the previous game with 15 frames of landing lag (halved from 30), but should still be used cautiously."
"839","Jigglypuff","Grab","","—","Reaches out. Has very short range, but is very fast, with only Pichu's grab being faster."
"840","Jigglypuff","Pummel","","1.3%","Kicks the opponent."
"841","Jigglypuff","Forward throw","","5% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Puffs up once to launch the opponent forward. Despite its moderate knockback, its KO potential is abysmal. Instead, it is much more effective for setting up edgeguards due to its low endlag."
"842","Jigglypuff","Back throw","","10%","A German suplex. Like its forward throw, this move is useful for setting up edgeguards."
"843","Jigglypuff","Up throw","","8%","Spins once to fling the opponent upward, leaving a trail of sparkles. Has high base knockback, but is offset by its low growth."
"844","Jigglypuff","Down throw","","6% (hit 1), 6% (throw)","Pins the opponent to the ground and then rolls back and forth on their back, which launches them upward."
"845","Jigglypuff","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Spins around to kick in front of itself and behind itself."
"846","Jigglypuff","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Kicks in front of itself and behind itself."
"847","Jigglypuff","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Spins on the ground, kicking on both sides."
"848","Jigglypuff","Edge attack","","8%","Performs a flipping kick while climbing up the stage."
"849","Jigglypuff","Neutral special","Rollout","10% (minimally charged), 20% (fully charged)","Rolls forward to slam into the opponent. Its power, range, and speed can be increased by holding the special button. It cannot be held indefinitely, however, and will automatically release a little bit after it reaches max charge. When fully charged, it does quite a bit of shield damage. If not charged until Jigglypuff glows, it will harmlessly roll once. On the ground, Rollout's direction can be changed mid-roll, which deals no damage until the turn is complete; in the air, pressing left or right will alter Jigglypuff's roll speed. When Rollout is fully charged, Jigglypuff will voice its name and briefly flash. Hitting a non-shielding opponent will cause Jigglypuff to rebound, which renders it unable to do anything else, apart from shifting its direction, until it lands or is hit. It can, however, control its direction during the rebound. This makes Rollout dangerous to use off-stage or at an edge, since the rebound will cause Jigglypuff to spin helplessly as it descends to the lower blast line. It can grab edges during the rebound, but it's still unsafe, especially if Rollout is perfect shielded."
"850","Jigglypuff","Side special","Pound","11%","Rears its arm back and then throws a punch, taking a step forward. Deals moderate knockback, though unable to KO at realistic percents. Its momentum moves Jigglypuff sideways (which can be slightly shifted upwards by pushing the control stick up immediately after the input), making it one of the two special moves it can use to recover. It also does a high amount of shield damage and has a surprisingly large, long-lasting hitbox that doesn't lose power."
"851","Jigglypuff","Up special","Sing","0%","Sings a song that puts nearby opponents to sleep. The more damaged opponents are, the longer they will sleep, making them open for a followup attack, most notably Rest. Jigglypuff can sweetspot ledges during the entire move, allowing Sing to set up a punish from a ledge. However, the song is short-ranged, consists of three brief pauses, and leaves Jigglypuff itself slightly vulnerable to being attacked. Unlike typical up specials, Sing does not grant any vertical distance, but it does retain slight mobility ."
"852","Jigglypuff","Down special","Rest","20% (move), 1% (flower loop)","Falls asleep, dealing a single hard hit to any opponents directly touching Jigglypuff. It has almost no start-up lag (1 frame) and deals an extreme amount of vertical knockback if landed, and benefits from rage, due to possessing very high base knockback. It also puts a flower on the opponent's head that deals continuous damage. If Rest lands, Jigglypuff will be able to act as soon as its eyes open, making it somewhat hard to punish. It takes it slightly longer to act if it whiffs; after it opens its eyes, but before it shakes itself. Jigglypuff gains invincibility for a few frames when the move is used (before its eyes close) which can initially prevent counterattacks from hitting Jigglypuff, though this is detrimental due to the move's extreme ending lag."
"853","Jigglypuff","Final Smash","Puff Up","10% (hit 1), 25% (hit 2)","Rapidly inflates itself to a gargantuan size and launches all opponents near it horizontally while saying ""Jiggly!"" before ""popping"" and quickly deflating back to its normal size. Jigglypuff's size is so great when inflating that its body completely takes up smaller stages and even some medium-sized ones, making it difficult to escape. There are two hitboxes, with the second one dealing more damage and knockback than the first."
"854","Pichu","Neutral attack","","1.2%","Does a quick headbutt."
"855","Pichu","Forward tilt","","8%, 1% recoil","Plants itself on its upper paws and kicks both its feet upward in front of itself quickly (comes out on frame 5), yet it has above average power and can KO at high percents. Can make opponents trip at low percents. Cannot be angled as it could in Melee."
"856","Pichu","Up tilt","","5%","Swipes its tail above its body in an arc. Can combo into itself at low percents, or into an aerial at mid to high percents."
"857","Pichu","Down tilt","","6%","Swipes its tail in front of itself. Has very low knockback scaling, allowing it to combo into up tilt at low to mid percents, or an aerial even at very high percents."
"858","Pichu","Dash attack","","8% (clean), 6% (late)","Jumps and headbutts forward. Less ending lag but less shieldstun compared to Pikachu's. It also has an hitbox on Pichu's torso."
"859","Pichu","Forward smash","","2% (hits 1-5), 8% (hit 6), 2% recoil","Launches a short jolt of electricity from its cheeks. Comes out on frame 16 and is a multihits attack. Stronger than Pikachu's version and does not have sourspots, but has much less range."
"860","Pichu","Up smash","","14%","Does an upward headbutt. Pichu's ears become intangible on frames 9-11. Comes out on frame 9, making it quick for a smash attack. However, its knockback is rather poor for a smash attack."
"861","Pichu","Down smash","","1.5% (hits 1-4), 8% (hit 6), 1.3% recoil","Discharges electricity while quickly spinning in place. Compared to Pikachu's, it has much less ending lag and it is overall stronger, but it's easier to DI and has less range. Pichu also gains invincibility at frames 7-10."
"862","Pichu","Neutral aerial","","7% (clean), 5% (late)","Somersaults in the air. A quick out of shield option, is more effective than Pikachu's for KOing and has more range and less ending lag. Autocancels in a full hop, but is slightly safer when not autocanceled, having 2 less frames of landing lag compared to Pikachu's."
"863","Pichu","Forward aerial","","3.5% (hits 1-4), 1.5% recoil","Does a forward barrel roll. Unlike Pikachu's, it covers Pichu's whole body. Can combo into itself at lower percents."
"864","Pichu","Back aerial","","2% (hits 1-5), 2.5% (hit 6), 1.5% recoil","Does an electric spin similar to its down smash. Can combo at low percentages and edgeguard at higher percents, just like forward aerial. Decent knockback."
"865","Pichu","Up aerial","","4%","Flicks its tail above itself. Good for combos, especially into Thunder. Autocancels in a short hop with less landing lag than Pikachu's version."
"866","Pichu","Down aerial","","13%, 4% (landing), 1.5% recoil after startup, 0.5% recoil landing (can land before startup)","Does a downward barrel roll. Has the capability to meteor smash opponents and autocancels in a short hop. Pichu's ears become intangible for the entire duration of the clean hit(frames 14-17). The late hit has good coverage in Pichu's body."
"867","Pichu","Grab","","—","Quickly leans forward and grabs with one arm. Has a range of approximately Pichu's body width, being somewhat short-ranged. Its grabs are the fastest in the game."
"868","Pichu","Pummel","","1.4%, 0.1% recoil","Shocks the opponent. Above average power and moderate speed."
"869","Pichu","Forward throw","","1.5% (hits 1-4), 6% (throw), 0.8% recoil","Places the opponent on its back and shocks them, sending them forward. Pichu's strongest throw, it starts KOing middleweights at around 153% near the edge of Final Destination."
"870","Pichu","Back throw","","9%","Does a backwards somersaults with the opponent, then flings them behind itself. Pichu's second strongest throw, but it can only KO middleweight late, starting at around 181% at the edge of Final Destination."
"871","Pichu","Up throw","","5% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Tosses foe up and headbutts them. Can infamously combo into Thunder making it a reliable finisher between medium and high percents."
"872","Pichu","Down throw","","4% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Places opponent on the ground, then jumps on them. Can combo into an aerial at low to mid percents."
"873","Pichu","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Does a full rotation sweep with its tail."
"874","Pichu","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Does a full rotation sweep with its tail."
"875","Pichu","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings its tail on both sides of itself."
"876","Pichu","Edge attack","","9%","Climbs up then flicks its tail out."
"877","Pichu","Neutral special","Thunder Jolt","7% (short distance), 6% (medium distance), 5% (long distance), 10% (ball), 0.7% recoil","Pichu's main projectile. Fires a jolt of electricity forward. Compared to Pikachu's, it is faster, bigger and stronger. It also travels forward while bouncing along the ground, and can also travel up walls, below the edge, and along ceilings, making it a strong edgeguarding and 2 framing tool. If used in the air, it will travel diagonally down instead. Disappears after around 3 seconds. Can be used to gimp certain recoveries. Deals less damage the farther it travels."
"878","Pichu","Side special","Skull Bash","4% (uncharged), 7.8% (uncharged smash input), 33% (fully charged), 1.8% recoil","Charges and, when the B button is released, fires itself forward like a missile. When fully charged or close to fully charged, it has KO power. The move can also be used to extend Pichu's recovery, though it does have some lag. Compared to Pikachu's Skull Bash, Pichu's Skull Bash deals more damage and covers more distance when fully charged, but deals less damage when uncharged, takes longer to fully charge, causes recoil damage and has more endlag."
"879","Pichu","Up special","Agility","0%, 0.9% recoil (warp 1), 1.4% recoil (warp 2)","Pichu's primary recovery move. Moves at warp speed in two directions that can be selected via the control stick. Compared to Pikachu's Quick Attack, Agility travels farther. However, it deals no damage and Pichu suffers recoil damage."
"880","Pichu","Down special","Thunder","14% (shockwave), 4% (thunderbolt), 6% (thunderbolt meteor), 3.5% recoil","Summons a thundercloud from which a lightning bolt comes down and strikes Pichu. The start of the bolt has a meteor effect and deals more damage than the rest of the bolt. When the bolt hits Pichu, a shockwave is generated than has the potential to KO. Pichu also gains intangibility for 10 frames if it connects, just like Pikachu. Compared to Pikachu's Thunder, Pichu's Thunder has less startup but deals less damage and knockback overall and causes recoil damage."
"881","Pichu","Final Smash","Volt Tackle","0.3% (6 hits during startup), 1% (initial hit), 1.6% (loop), 21% (launch), 3.2% recoil (startup), 0.2% recoil (loop), 3.5% recoil (launch)","Pichu turns into a ball of electricity and dashes forward. Any opponents hit are knocked into the center of the screen where Pichu furiously tackles them from multiple directions then releases a powerful electric blast in the center. If the dash doesn't hit an opponent, the final smash is ended early."
"882","Mewtwo","Neutral attack","","4%","Extends its arm to emit a pulse of dark energy. Repeatedly pressing the attack button causes Mewtwo to sway its arm up and down to emit multiple pulses of dark energy before finishing with a dark energy-infused upward swipe. The first hit can jab reset. The infinite's finisher also has decent knockback and can KO at very high percentages near the ledge."
"883","Mewtwo","Neutral attack","","1% (loop), 2% (last)","Extends its arm to emit a pulse of dark energy. Repeatedly pressing the attack button causes Mewtwo to sway its arm up and down to emit multiple pulses of dark energy before finishing with a dark energy-infused upward swipe. The first hit can jab reset. The infinite's finisher also has decent knockback and can KO at very high percentages near the ledge."
"884","Mewtwo","Forward tilt","","11% (near), 10% (mid), 9% (far)","Spins, then swings its tail forward. It is Mewtwo's strongest tilt attack, has good range and can be angled, all of which make it useful for spacing. It is also a decent KOing option at around 120% near the ledge."
"885","Mewtwo","Up tilt","","7% (nearest), 6% (near), 5% (far), 4% (farthest), 5.5% (farthest hitbox to opponents in front of Mewtwo)","Telekinetically backflips to swing its tail in an overhead arcing motion. Its near hitboxes send at favorable angles for comboing into itself, an up smash, neutral aerial, back aerial, or up aerial at low percentages. It can also be used for juggling beginning at medium percentages. It covers a very wide range, hitting opponents near Mewtwo's back, making it a reliable move for catching landings."
"886","Mewtwo","Down tilt","Tail Sweep","5% (near), 4.5% (mid), 4% (far)","Crouches and spins around to swing its tail in front of itself. Due to it hitting on frame 6 and having low ending lag, it is Mewtwo's fastest tilt, which allows it to function as a good out of shield option. It is also among Mewtwo's best combo starters, being able to combo into an up tilt, up smash, neutral aerial, forward aerial, and up aerial."
"887","Mewtwo","Dash attack","","12% (clean sweetspot), 9% (clean sourspot), 6% (late sweetspot), 4% (late sourspot)","A lunging, dark energy-infused palm thrust. Its clean sweetspot deals above average knockback, which can KO at very high percentages. Depending on the hitbox it hits with and the opponent's damage, it can combo into neutral, forward, and up aerial. Its disjointed hitbox grants it impressive range for a dash attack, which makes it a decent punishment option at certain distances, and potentially difficult for the opponent to punish from a proper distance."
"888","Mewtwo","Forward smash","Shadow Blast","20% (blast), 16% (arms)","Quickly cups its hands to its side, and then thrusts them forward to perform a double palm thrust that emits a blast of dark energy. It is Mewtwo's most damaging smash attack, and is an incredibly powerful punish out of a shield break or Disable, KOing at around 65% near the ledge uncharged, and even its sourspot has respectable power. Due to it hitting on frame 19 and having 31 frames of ending lag, however, it is very punishable when whiffed, though it is relatively safe on shield when spaced. It can be angled. It resembles Mewtwo's special move animation from Pokemon Stadium."
"889","Mewtwo","Up smash","Galaxy Force","2% (hits 1-3), 10% (hit 4)","Thrusts its arm upward to emit a swirling blast of dark energy. It functions very well as an anti-air attack due to the energy blast itself being a large disjoint that covers above Mewtwo's head, along with boasting multi-hit properties and having a long duration. Due to it hitting on frame 9, it is quite fast for a smash attack of its power, and has the lowest amount of start-up lag out of Mewtwo's smash attacks. However, it has the highest endlag out of Mewtwo's entire moveset at 46 frames, making it very punishable."
"890","Mewtwo","Down smash","Shadow Bomb","16%","Extends its arm at a diagonal angle toward the ground to emit a blast of dark energy from its fingertip. It is one of the few down smashes that does not hit on both sides, but it is powerful nonetheless, and has the highest knockback scaling out of Mewtwo's entire moveset. While it has noticeable startup at frame 21, its ending lag relative to its power and startup is extremely low, as Mewtwo can act out of it after 41 frames. As such, it is safe on shield, and potentially even on whiff. It can also 2-frame punish at the ledge if timed correctly. As a result, Mewtwo's down smash is overall very versatile due to its safety and power, and serves as a great punishment out of a successful Disable or shield break."
"891","Mewtwo","Neutral aerial","Body Spark","1.6% (hits 1-5), 4% (hit 6)","Discharges electricity around itself with its limbs spread out. With only 7 frames of startup, it is tied with forward aerial for having the lowest startup lag out of Mewtwo's aerials. Its hitboxes are positioned at Mewtwo's hands and feet and keep the opponent trapped, whereas its last hitbox launches them. As a result, it is very useful for disrupting opponents, as Mewtwo has full control over its aerial movement during the attack. Its linking hits can also drag opponents down if fast-falling, which can lead to grounded follow-ups and even gimps."
"892","Mewtwo","Forward aerial","Shadow Scratch","13%","A dark energy-infused swipe. Due to it hitting on frame 7, it is tied with neutral aerial for having the lowest amount of start-up lag out of Mewtwo's aerial attacks. When coupled with its respectable damage output and high knockback scaling, it is one of Mewtwo's most viable KOing options. It also boasts combo potential at low percentages, as it can also combo into itself, or be used as a follow-up from down tilt or neutral aerial. Due to its very fast speed, versatility at a wide range of percentages (boasting combo and KO potential at low and high percentages, respectively), and decent range, it is a staple in Mewtwo's neutral game and moveset, and it is not uncommon for it to be considered one of the best forward aerials in the game."
"893","Mewtwo","Back aerial","","13% (near), 11% (mid), 9% (far)","Swings its tail behind itself in an upward arc. It covers a very wide area and deals relatively high knockback, making it very potent at edgeguarding, particularly against midair jumps, and allows it to easily wall out opposing approaches. However, it has the second highest amount of start-up lag out of Mewtwo's aerial attacks at frame 13."
"894","Mewtwo","Up aerial","","12% (near), 11% (mid), 10% (far)","Backflips to swing its tail in an overhead arcing motion, similarly to its up tilt. Its good knockback growth, large range and decent damage output makes it a viable juggling and KOing option. Despite its appearance, it is unable to hit opponents next to Mewtwo, unless if used during a fast-fall near the ground (which can start combos at low percentages)."
"895","Mewtwo","Down aerial","","14% (grounded opponents, aerial sourspot), 15% (aerial sweetspot)","Backflips to perform a dark energy-infused stomp. It is Mewtwo's most damaging aerial attack. It is also a very powerful meteor smash when sweetspotted in the air. Due to it hitting on frame 15, however, it has the highest amount of start-up lag out of Mewtwo's aerials. Despite its aforementioned dark energy visuals appearing right where Mewtwo stomps, it does not have a darkness effect. Its sourspot boasts respectable power and can KO grounded opponents at around 140%. Its moderately low landing lag combined with its diagonal angle also allows it to function as a low-percentage combo starter."
"896","Mewtwo","Grab","","—","Telekinetically holds an opponent. Mewtwo's grab range and speed are average."
"897","Mewtwo","Pummel","","2%","Releases a pulse of darkness into the opponent. A fairly fast pummel."
"898","Mewtwo","Forward throw","Shadow Cannon","3% (hit 1), 2% (Shadow Balls)","Telekinetically lifts the opponent diagonally in the air before firing five Shadow Balls at them. It is among the most damaging throws in the game when all hits connect, dealing 13%. However, the Shadow Balls can be reflected if the opponent wears a Franklin Badge, while other nearby opponents with reflectors and/or absorption moves can choose to intercept it, while opponents can also DI to avoid other incoming projectiles at higher percentages."
"899","Mewtwo","Back throw","","11%","Telekinetically throws the opponent backward. Its high damage and knockback makes it one of the strongest back throws in the game and one of Mewtwo's most viable KOing moves, KOing middleweights at around 95% near the ledge."
"900","Mewtwo","Up throw","Psychic Whirlwind","12%","Telekinetically whirls the opponent around itself before launching them upward above its head. This is the strongest up throw in the game, while being difficult to properly DI due to its purely vertical angle. As a result, it is extremely useful for KOing at high percentages if Mewtwo lands a grab, especially on stages with platforms. It KOs middleweights at around 131% from ground level, and at around 100% on Battlefield's top platform."
"901","Mewtwo","Down throw","","4% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Telekinetically slams the opponent to the ground, and then somersaults in order to strike them with its tail. It has low knockback and somewhat high ending lag. As a result, it cannot properly combo into most of its moves until very high percentages, though it can be used to punish an opponent's reaction or create 50/50 setups."
"902","Mewtwo","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Telekinetically spins around to swing its tail before getting up."
"903","Mewtwo","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Telekinetically spins around to swing its tail before getting up."
"904","Mewtwo","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Performs a dark energy-infused swipe behind itself and then in front of itself while getting up."
"905","Mewtwo","Edge attack","","7%","Swings its tail in front of itself while climbing up."
"906","Mewtwo","Neutral special","Shadow Ball","2.5% (uncharged), 25% (fully charged)","Cups its hands to its side and creates a large, blackish violet sphere of dark energy between its hands, then thrusts its hands forward to launch the sphere. It can be fired immediately, which, when coupled with its erratic movement pattern, allows it to function as a pressuring option like Fireball. Conversely, it can be charge-canceled. Although its charge time is quite long, it possesses great KO potential when fully charged. A fully charged Shadow Ball also deals above-average shield damage and possesses transcendent priority, being able to break shields at half health or less. A fully charged Shadow Ball also deals recoil upon being fired; as a result, using it in midair will propel Mewtwo a moderate distance backward, which can help or hinder its recovery depending on which way it faces. Shadow Ball can potentially act as a combo starter at various percentages depending on its charge, notably into moves like dash attack, dash grab, and forward aerial."
"907","Mewtwo","Side special","Confusion","1.15% (hits 1-7), 1% (throw), 1.4× (reflected projectiles)","Swipes forward to emit a ripple of psychic energy from its hand. It has impressive utility, courtesy of it functioning as a reflector, a command grab, and even a potential recovery option. As a grab, the ripple spins opponents around and leaves them tumbling at a frame disadvantage dependent on their damage, being able to combo into down tilt and forward aerial at high percents, with the latter being a KO setup. As a recovery option, its first use in midair gives Mewtwo a slight vertical boost, although it halts most of its horizontal momentum."
"908","Mewtwo","Up special","Teleport","—","Teleports to a different location. It is completely invulnerable during the move. It has less ending lag if Mewtwo Teleports directly back onto the ground, and it grants Mewtwo some horizontal momentum if ended in midair. A great recovery move due to its aforementioned intangibility as well as travelling a long distance."
"909","Mewtwo","Down special","Disable","1%","Emits a minuscule spark of psychic energy from its eyes toward the opponent, stunning them. It only works if the opponent is facing Mewtwo and grounded. If the opponent is in the air, they are slightly launched backward with set knockback, instead of being stunned, which will likely put them into a tech situation and potentially allow another opportunity to land the move. Useful at high percentages to guarantee a KO, but difficult to land. Due to being a projectile, Disable can also be reflected. Disable grants intangibility from frames 10 to 16, allowing it to beat out grounded maneuvers when timed properly, such as dash grabs."
"910","Mewtwo","Final Smash","Psystrike","40%","Mega Evolves into Mega Mewtwo Y and performs Psystrike, its signature move in the Pokémon games. Psystrike is a powerful sphere of psychic energy that plows through both opponents and walls, and any opponent caught will be stunned before being launched by an intense, mind-shattering blow. Incredible power, KOing at around 50% from center stage."
"911","Lucario","Neutral attack","","2.5%","The kham choui[1] (a downward sweeping punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), followed by the choong choui[2] (a jab-style punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), followed by a stretch kick."
"912","Lucario","Neutral attack","","2%","The kham choui[1] (a downward sweeping punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), followed by the choong choui[2] (a jab-style punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), followed by a stretch kick."
"913","Lucario","Neutral attack","","3%","The kham choui[1] (a downward sweeping punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), followed by the choong choui[2] (a jab-style punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), followed by a stretch kick."
"914","Lucario","Forward tilt","","4% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","The kap theai choui[3] (a low-angle cross-style punch in Shaolin Kung Fu). Hits twice. At higher levels of aura, it becomes a viable KO option."
"915","Lucario","Up tilt","","6% (foot), 5%","An outside crescent kick above itself. A good juggling and combo tool. Has a sweetspot on its foot."
"916","Lucario","Down tilt","","5%","A kneeling Hapkido-style shin kick. It can be used in rather quick succession and has decent range."
"917","Lucario","Dash attack","","8.5% (sourspot), 10% (sweetspot), 7% (late)","A flying kick. Its decent speed and good range allow it to function as a decent punishment tool, and its sweetspot allows it to KO at very high percentages."
"918","Lucario","Forward smash","","16% (clean), 13% (late)","A double palm thrust, which emits a burst of Aura. When at max aura, it is extremely powerful; it is the strongest smash attack in the game overall, as it has the potential to one-hit KO almost every fighter in the roster when fully charged. However, its noticeable startup and ending lag makes it punishable."
"919","Lucario","Up smash","","4% (hit 1),  14% (clean hit 2),  9% (late hit 2)","A modified version of the long choui[4] (an uppercut-styled punch in Shaolin Kung Fu), while emitting a blast of Aura. Hits twice. One of the strongest up smashes in the game, and the most damaging smash attack in the game when at max aura."
"920","Lucario","Down smash","","14%","Thrusts its palms in front and behind, while emitting blasts of Aura. Resembles a modified version of the kap theai choui. Hits on both of its sides simultaneously, making it a good option to punish rolls. Very strong at max aura, KOing below 60% at the ledge at max aura."
"921","Lucario","Neutral aerial","","8% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Spins while emitting Aura from its paws. It hits twice, and the first hit can be used to combo into grounded moves on landing."
"922","Lucario","Forward aerial","","6%","A stretch kick. Its diagonal-vertical launch angle and low knockback make it an excellent combo tool, allowing it to string into itself and combo into moves like neutral aerial and up aerial."
"923","Lucario","Back aerial","","14% (clean), 13% (late)","The sou choui[5] (a sweeping punch in Shaolin Kung Fu). At max aura, it is one of the strongest back aerials in the game, KOing at around 50% at the ledge. However, it is Lucario's slowest aerial."
"924","Lucario","Up aerial","","11% (clean), 6% (late)","An bicycle kick with Lucario facing the screen. Extremely powerful at max aura, capable of KOing at around 80% even at ground level. Outside of that, it makes for a good juggling tool. Its late hit can act as a potential KO setup into its sweetspot on landing."
"925","Lucario","Down aerial","","5% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Stomps twice, emitting blasts of Aura with each stomp. It stalls Lucario in the air temporarily and deals great damage at higher levels of aura."
"926","Lucario","Grab","","—","Clinches the opponent."
"927","Lucario","Pummel","","1.3%","A surge of Aura. Quite fast."
"928","Lucario","Forward throw","","5% (hit), 3% (throw)","Shoves the opponent away. A very fast throw, along with being one of the strongest forward throws in the game at max aura."
"929","Lucario","Back throw","","10%","The tai otoshi[6], a Judo throw. It deals very high damage and knockback when at max aura."
"930","Lucario","Up throw","","5% (hit), 6% (throw)","The pao choui[7] (an uppercut-styled punch in Shaolin Kung Fu). One of Lucario's best combo starters, as it can follow up with a neutral aerial, forward aerial, and an up aerial or back aerial as a 50/50 KO setup."
"931","Lucario","Down throw","","7%","Holds the opponent over its head and then slams them into the ground. A good combo starter, as it can combo into a forward aerial, a neutral aerial or an up aerial."
"932","Lucario","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Kicks around itself before getting up."
"933","Lucario","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Same as its frontal floor attack."
"934","Lucario","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Kicks behind itself and then in front of itself while getting up."

"936","Lucario","Neutral special","Aura Sphere","6.9%~17.2% (move), 0.6% (charge loop)","A chargeable, condensed sphere of Aura. Pressing the special button again will make Lucario fire the sphere. Its size scales with Aura. The charge can be cancelled into tilts, smash attacks, and aerials. It can also cancel into a dodge, and be jump-cancelled."
"937","Lucario","Side special","Force Palm","11.8% (close blast), 5.4% (far blast), 13% (throw), 10% (throw collateral)","Fires a stream of Aura. Its blast's range scales with Aura. If the opponent is close to Lucario, the move acts like a grab, with Lucario grabbing the opponent and then striking them with a palm thrust at point-blank range. At half of its maximum Aura or more, it triggers Special Zoom, and deals immense damage and knockback, KOing at around 60% near the ledge."
"938","Lucario","Up special","Extreme Speed","6% (dash), 4% (impact)","Propels itself in a predetermined direction by blasting steams of Aura from its forepaws. Has a hitbox at the end of its animation, and upon crashing directly into a wall or the ground. Extreme Speed's distance scales with Aura."
"939","Lucario","Down special","Double Team","12.5%","Performs a kata. If Lucario is attacked, it will disappear while emitting afterimages and then counterattacks with a flying kick. The direction Lucario kicks in can be controlled. Lucario will also aim above or below if it is hit accordingly. Unlike most counters, it does not scale based on the attack it counters; it scales based on Lucario's aura."
"940","Lucario","Final Smash","Aura Storm","0.8% (loop), 11.5% (final hit)","Mega Evolves into Mega Lucario, then leaps up above the center of the stage, and firing a huge stream of Aura. Increases in power depending on Lucario's Aura and can achieve OHKO power at max aura if all hitboxes connect."
"941","Greninja","Neutral attack","","2%","Two alternating palm thrusts followed by a double palm thrust that emits a small blast of water. If button mashed, it is instead followed by a series of knifehand strikes that emit blade-shaped blasts of water that concludes with an outward knifehand strike that emits a small blast of water.

"947","Greninja","Down tilt","","4%","Greninja does a downward hand sweep. It sends opponents at an upward angle, making it a versatile combo starter. Notably, it can confirm a KO into an up smash rather easily."
"948","Greninja","Dash attack","","8%","A sweep kick. Sends opponents at a favorable angle for combos."

"951","Greninja","Down smash","","13% (kunai), 11% (arms)","Hits both sides with water kunai. Due to it sending opponents at an semi-spike angle and coming out on frame 10, it is a quick and effective way to set up an edge-guard situation."

"953","Greninja","Forward aerial","","14%","A forward slash with a water kunai. It has some start-up and suffers from high end lag, but it is a viable edge-guarding and KOing option."

"959","Greninja","Forward throw","","3.5% (hit 1), 4.5% (throw)","Shoves the opponent forward. Can KO at high percentages."
"960","Greninja","Back throw","","9%","Greninja leans forward and flings the opponent backwards. Like forward throw, its decent knockback gives it good edgeguarding and KO potential at high percentages."
"961","Greninja","Up throw","","11%","Tosses the opponent upwards. One of Greninja's most useful throws, as it can combo into a up tilt, up aerial, up smash at low and medium percents and can even KO at later percents."
"962","Greninja","Down throw","","12%","Slams the opponent onto the ground. It can combo into a down tilt, forward tilt, forward smash, dash attack and a Shadow Sneak at low percentages. It can also combo into forward aerial at higher percentages."
"963","Greninja","Floor attack (front)","","8%","Sweep kicks around itself while getting up."
"964","Greninja","Floor attack (back)","","8%","Sweep kicks around itself while getting up."

"966","Greninja","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a roundhouse kick while climbing up."
"967","Greninja","Neutral special","Water Shuriken","3%-10.8% (uncharged), 1.0% (fully charged looping hits), 9% (fully charged final hit)","Uses Water Shuriken, which can be charged. Depending on how long the move is charged, the shuriken will be larger and do more damage, however the speed and distance will decrease as a result. At full charge, it hits multiple times and is a decent KOing option. A fully charged water shuriken that is reflected at a higher speed will have trouble landing the final hit on Greninja because of the looping hits not moving Greninja far enough for it."
"968","Greninja","Side special","Shadow Sneak","10% (normal), 12% (reverse)","Disappears briefly, then preforms a forward kick or a drop kick (relative to the user's reappearance in relation to the enemy) to attack. The move activates when the special button is released. The way the shadow moves is relative to Greninja's position, and it can be moved further or closer to change how far Greninja teleports. While performing Shadow Sneak, Greninja cannot run, attack, grab, dodge or shield. However, it can walk slowly, jump and taunt."
"969","Greninja","Up special","Hydro Pump","2% (per shot)","Uses Hydro Pump to propel itself in the inputted direction, it can be used twice. Each shot has a windbox effect that pushes opponents, making it a decent option for gimping predictable recoveries."
"970","Greninja","Down special","Substitute","14% (up or down), 11% (left or right)","Does a pose, if anyone hits it while posing, Greninja will temporarily disappear and get replaced by a wooden log or a Substitute doll then appear behind the opponent and strike them. It deviates noticeably from other counters, as the attack itself can be angled in an inputted direction and launching the opponent in that direction (with the down input meteor smashing opponents, which makes it a good punish against reckless edgeguarders)."
"971","Greninja","Final Smash","Secret Ninja Attack","6% (the mat), 50% (Total in the attack after mat)","Turns into Ash-Greninja and attacks the opponent with a mat. If an opponent is caught in the mat, Greninja will send them up into the air and strike the opponent repeatedly in midair with its kunai, before slamming them down with a final hit."
"972","Ness","Neutral attack","","2%","Two punches followed by a front kick. The first and second hits can lock."

"974","Ness","Neutral attack","","4%","Two punches followed by a front kick. The first and second hits can lock."
"975","Ness","Forward tilt","","10%","A roundhouse kick that can be angled. Surprisingly good power, KOing at around 120% at the ledge."
"976","Ness","Up tilt","","7% (spark), 5% (body)","Jumps and attacks with an upward double palm thrust that produces a PSI spark from his hands. Has a sourspot located on his body that deals 5%. A decent anti-air and juggling tool."
"977","Ness","Down tilt","","4.5% (foot), 3% (toes)","A swift shin kick. Extremely spammable and can be used to lock. Has a sourspot located on the tip of his foot."
"978","Ness","Dash attack","","4% (hit 1), 7% (hit 1 aerial), 2% (hit 2), 4% (hit 3)","A double palm thrust that sends three PSI sparks out in front of him with the third spark knocking the opponent up into the air. The first spark deals more damage to aerial targets. Good to set up juggles and pressuring from afar. Difficult to punish on shield if only the last hit connects. The disjointed hitboxes go very far, giving it impressive range for a dash attack. The first hit is more damaging on opponents in the air."
"979","Ness","Forward smash","Batter Up!","18% (low), 20% (mid), 22% (tip), 2× damage (reflected projectiles)","Swings his bat. It can reflect incoming projectiles with a high multiplier and is one of the strongest forward smashes in the game, killing most characters around 50% by the ledge. However, its lag is considerable and makes it easy to punish up close."
"980","Ness","Up smash","Around the World","1% (charge), 13%","Sends his yo-yo forward and performs an ""around-the-world"", hitting first in front then above and behind. It has a hitbox while charging and can hang from the ledge, but can only be held for an additional half of a second instead of two, and has a max charge damage multiplier of 1.2×."
"981","Ness","Down smash","Walk the Dog","1% (charge), 10%","Sends his yo-yo backward and performs the ""walk-the-dog"" with it, hitting first behind then in front. It has a hitbox while charging and can hang from the ledge, but can only be held for an additional half of a second instead of two, and has a max charge damage multiplier of 1.2×. Might have troubles linking correctly if the opponent is at the furthest point of the back hit."
"982","Ness","Neutral aerial","","11% (clean), 7% (late)","Spins diagonally in the air with his arms outstretched, emitting PSI from his hands. Quick, coming out on frame 4 and acts like a sex kick. Rather useful to break combos and as an out-of-shield option. Autocancels from a short hop. It has decent knockback, making it a good edgeguarding and KOing option."
"983","Ness","Forward aerial","","1.5% (hit 1-3), 5.5% (hit 4)","A double palm thrust that generates a stream of PSI sparks from his hands. Comes out on frame 8,making it tied with up aerial for the second fastest out of Ness's aerials. Decently safe on shield if Ness backs away during the attack, and it's useful to start and continue combos. Autocancels from a short hop. Can chain into itself multiple times at low percentages, making it a useful wall-of-pain tool."
"984","Ness","Back aerial","","15% (clean), 8% (late)","A dropkick that produces a PSI spark. Comes out on frame 10. The clean hit is very strong, being his strongest aerial overall. Autocancels from a short hop."
"985","Ness","Up aerial","","2.5% (hits 1-4), 5% (hit 5)","Waves his finger in an arc above his head while generating PSI sparkles, hitting up to 5 times. Autocancels from a short hop. A great combo tool, as its linking hits and last hit's vertical angle combine to make it a great combo extender. It can also KO well near the upper blast line at high percentages since the final hit has extremely high knockback scaling. Overall great power."
"986","Ness","Down aerial","","14% (clean), 12% (late)","Twirls before kicking down into the air, producing a PSI spark. The clean hit can meteor smash, and can be used to start combos on-stage fairly reliably if landed against grounded opponents. Autocancels from a short hop. Ness's slowest aerial, coming out on frame 20."
"987","Ness","Grab","","—","Grabs with both hands. A fast grab with a slight amount of ending lag."
"988","Ness","Pummel","","1.3%","Attacks the opponent with a discharge of PSI energy."
"989","Ness","Forward throw","PK Throw","11%","Psychokinetically swings his opponent in a small circle in front of himself before sending them off forward. Very high base knockback, but incredibly low knockback scaling, which gives it little to no KO potential even after Sudden Death percentages. It is useful for setting up an edgeguard, however, or KO'ing an opponent early on if near the blastzone."
"990","Ness","Back throw","Reverse PK Throw","11%","Psychokinetically swings the opponent over his head before sending them off backward, in a diagonally upwards motion. It is the opposite of his forward throw, possessing very low base knockback but incredibly high knockback scaling, making it one of the strongest back throws in the game, and considered the most versatile KO throw overall, as it can KO much more reliably anywhere onstage at higher percentages than most other back throws at its level of strength like Incineroar's or Dr. Mario's, due to its much higher knockback scaling."
"991","Ness","Up throw","","10%","Psychokinetically spins the opponent above his head before sending them up. It leaves the opponent in an unfavorable position where they can be juggled, most commonly by PK Thunder."
"992","Ness","Down throw","","0.5% (hits 1-3), 1.5% (hit 4), 4% (throw)","Throws the opponent onto the ground and scorches them with PK Fire. A strong combo starter, having guaranteed follow-ups into neutral aerial, forward aerial and up aerial."
"993","Ness","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Sweep kicks in front of and behind himself."
"994","Ness","Floor attack (back)","","7%","With one hand planted on the ground, sweeps his leg behind and in front of himself."
"995","Ness","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Kicks behind and in front of himself with both legs."
"996","Ness","Edge attack","","9%","Flips onto the stage and does a sweep kick."
"997","Ness","Neutral special","PK Flash","11%-27%","A green sphere of light appears above Ness and flies forward in an arc if charged. The arc it travels can be controlled, and the projectile is able to go through soft and semisoft platforms and will not dissipate upon contact with hard platforms.
The longer the special button is held, the stronger the explosion will be."
"998","Ness","Side special","PK Fire","6% (bolt), 1% (fire)","Fires a yellow lightning-bolt shaped projectile, pushing back Ness slightly.
If used on the ground, it travels in a slight downward angle until it vanishes by itself or touches the ground (disappearing into a puff of smoke) or an enemy, making it explode into a quick-hitting pillar of flames.
If used in the air, it fires at a downward 45° angle."
"999","Ness","Up special","PK Thunder","11% (PK Thunder), 1% (Thunder's tail), 25% (PK Thunder 2 initial hitbox), 21% (PK Thunder 2 late hitbox)","Creates a fast-moving ball of thunder that can be aimed into opponents to deal damage and launch them in the direction they got hit from, or into Ness to turn him into a very powerful human projectile.
This is referred to as PK Thunder 2. The Rocket portion of the attack has invulnerability from frame 1 to 32 and is constituted of an early and late hit. Making contact with something during PKT2 will shorten the distance traveled, and slamming into a wall allows Ness to perform another PK Thunder if the player is sufficiently quick enough.
The tail of the thunder projectile can be used to disrupt opponents recovering."
"1000","Ness","Down special","PSI Magnet","4% per hit","Surrounds Ness with a purple energy field, allowing him to absorb energy-based projectiles (such as Mario's Fireball, Fox's Blaster or Samus's Charge Shot) or explosions (including all of Snake's explosives) and heal for 1.6× the damage he would have taken, but only at a maximum of 30% damage per projectile.
It possesses a hitbox on startup and if held, and will also slightly push back opponents on release. Upon absorption, the magnet can be canceled with a jump, roll or spotdodge. Can also be used to stall Ness's vertical momentum slightly in the air."
"1001","Ness","Final Smash","PK Starstorm","8% per hit","Paula and Poo join Ness, assisting him in summoning a shower of falling stars to attack his enemies. The comets will rain down over the stage and can be slightly aimed left and right."
"1002","Lucas","Neutral attack","","2.5%","A right-legged roundhouse kick, followed by a right-legged hook kick, followed by a left-legged reverse roundhouse kick. The last hit has slightly more range. Hits first on frame 2, making it Lucas' fastest ground attack. The first and second hits can jab lock. The second hit can be interrupted sooner than in Smash 4, and lead into a grab or aerial attack."
"1003","Lucas","Neutral attack","","1.5%","A right-legged roundhouse kick, followed by a right-legged hook kick, followed by a left-legged reverse roundhouse kick. The last hit has slightly more range. Hits first on frame 2, making it Lucas' fastest ground attack. The first and second hits can jab lock. The second hit can be interrupted sooner than in Smash 4, and lead into a grab or aerial attack."
"1004","Lucas","Neutral attack","","3.5%","A right-legged roundhouse kick, followed by a right-legged hook kick, followed by a left-legged reverse roundhouse kick. The last hit has slightly more range. Hits first on frame 2, making it Lucas' fastest ground attack. The first and second hits can jab lock. The second hit can be interrupted sooner than in Smash 4, and lead into a grab or aerial attack."
"1005","Lucas","Forward tilt","","11% (sweetspot), 7.5% (sourspot)","A palm thrust that emits a small blast of PSI energy from his hand. It can be angled and has a disjointed hitbox, although its sweetspot is located inside of the blast. This move's sourspot can lock opponents at low percents."
"1006","Lucas","Up tilt","","1.5% (hit 1), 8% (clean hit 2), 5% (late hit 2)","Telekinetically tilts himself upside down to perform a vertical thrust kick that emits a blast of PSI energy from his foot. It can combo into itself, a neutral aerial or an up aerial at low to medium percents."
"1007","Lucas","Down tilt","","5%","A legsweep. Although weak, it is fast and reliable for either racking up damage or chaining into itself, a neutral attack or a grab. Hits on frame 3, making it tied with Ness, Little Mac, R.O.B., and Meta Knight's down tilts for being the fastest down tilt in the game. The edge of down tilt unfortunately doesn't lock opponents like it used to do in other iterations."
"1008","Lucas","Dash attack","","13% (sweetspot), 9% (sourspot)","A dashing palm thrust that emits a blast of PSI energy from his hand. Has noticeable start-up and deals more damage the farther the opponent is from Lucas."
"1009","Lucas","Forward smash","","14% (base), 15% (tip), 1.5× (reflected projectiles)","Swings a stick in front of himself. The stick's tip deals slightly more damage and knockback, while the move overall functions very similarly to Ness' forward smash, including the ability to reflect projectiles. Compared to Ness' version, it has less start-up and ending lag, but deals less damage, knockback and has a lower damage multiplier when reflecting projectiles."
"1010","Lucas","Up smash","PK Smash Geyser","2% (hit 1), 21%, 20%, 18%, 16%, or 14% (clean to late hit 2)","Emits a large blast of PSI energy above his head. Despite in-game tips saying it  can attack opponents hanging on the edge, this is not true; the completely whiffs most edge-hanging characters unless their head pokes above the edge. It is a huge ""high-risk, high-reward"" attack; it has an extreme amount of ending lag, which makes it very punishable if missed, but it is strong enough to KO at 80% when uncharged and at 54% when fully charged. It also has other positives, as it renders Lucas invincible on frames 1-7, grants intangibility to his head on frames 15-29 and has a very large hitbox, making it a good anti-air attack if used correctly. The animation appears to based on Lucas' Seven Needles pulling animation."
"1011","Lucas","Down smash","PK Blow","17% (clean), 14% (mid), 11% (late)","Aims his arm diagonally downward and emits three consecutive blasts of PSI energy towards the ground while holding his hand in a finger gun gesture. With each blast, its range increases at the expense of damage and knockback. It is one of the strongest down smashes in the game when clean, as it is able to KO as low as 60% near the edge depending on the opponent's weight and DI. If well timed, it can also catch recovering opponents before they grab the edge. Has a bit of start-up lag, but surprisingly low ending lag for its power. Unlike in SSB4, each blast is treated as its own hitbox, meaning that it can potentially hit multiple times at low percents, and damages shields more than once."
"1012","Lucas","Neutral aerial","","2% (hits 1-3), 4% (hit 4)","Tumbles while emitting blasts of PSI energy around his torso. A good combo starter. Unlike in the previous game, its launching angle is more horizontal, and the last hit launches the opponent depending on which side they are on in relation to Lucas."
"1013","Lucas","Forward aerial","","12.5% (sweetspot), 9% (sourspot)","A flying kick that emits a blast of PSI energy from his foot. It is is fast and disjointed, making it a good off-stage option and one of Lucas' better spacing options. Its sweetspot deals the most knockback and can KO at high percents. This move's sourspot can lock opponents at early percents. It can also now autocancel."
"1014","Lucas","Back aerial","PK Meteor Kick","12% (sweetspot), 9% (sourspot), 7% (late)","A backflip kick that emits a trail of PSI energy from his foot. It can meteor smash at the tip of his foot and has disjointed reach, with its weakest hitbox being at the tip. The last hitbox of this move can lock opponents at early percents. It can also autocancel if buffered out of a shorthop."
"1015","Lucas","Up aerial","","11%","An upward headbutt. The move's hitbox is now properly attached to Lucas' head unlike in SSB4, making it a more reliable attack. Deals respectable knockback, making it a good KO option near the upper blast line. It can also autocancel. At low percentages, it is an effective juggling and combo tool, leading into itself and other aerials on landing."
"1016","Lucas","Down aerial","PK Foot Stomp","3.5% (hits 1-3), 5% (hit 4)","An alternating series of stomps, with each stomp emitting a small blast of PSI energy from his feet. Like his back aerial, it is disjointed and has a meteor smash hitbox below himself on the last hit, although it is fairly weak. The move itself is also difficult to fully land on smaller grounded opponents, such as Pikachu and Kirby. The last hitbox of this move can lock opponents at low percents."
"1017","Lucas","Grab aerial","Midair Rope Snake","5% (clean), 3% (late)","Unfurls Duster's Rope Snake in front of himself. It can damage opponents and act as a tether recovery."
"1018","Lucas","Grab","Rope Snake","—","Unfurls Duster's Rope Snake in front of himself. His standing grab is deceptively fast, although his pivot grab is very slow."
"1019","Lucas","Pummel","","1.3%","Attacks the opponent with a discharge of PSI energy."
"1020","Lucas","Forward throw","","10%","Telekinetically throws the opponent in front of himself. Can KO at high percentages."
"1021","Lucas","Back throw","","10%","Telekinetically throws the opponent behind himself. It is his strongest throw. It can KO even super heavyweights at 154% near the edge without rage."
"1022","Lucas","Up throw","","10%","Telekinetically whirls the opponent around his head, then throws them directly overhead. One of the strongest up throws in the game, as it KOs around 116%-180% depending on the opponent's weight and DI."
"1023","Lucas","Down throw","","11%","Telekinetically slams the opponent into the ground head first. Shows a bury effect, however this is purely aesthetic as the opponent is immediately unburied, and the duration of the bury does not change, even at 999%. Has significantly less combo ability than it did in SSB4 due to it's higher ending lag. Despite this, it still can combo at 0% on most characters, though the options are very limited."
"1024","Lucas","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Kicks around himself while getting up."
"1025","Lucas","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Kicks around himself while getting up."
"1026","Lucas","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Kicks behind himself and then in front of himself while getting up."
"1027","Lucas","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a low-angle kick while climbing up."
"1028","Lucas","Neutral special","PK Freeze","10%-23%","Emits a snowflake-shaped blast of PSI energy from his head that freezes opponents. The direction of the blast's path can be controlled, it can be made stronger by holding the special button and it can be concluded at a deceptively fast speed. A notoriously effective edgeguarding tool, as it launches opponents away from Lucas and has great maneuverability, as well as having a large hitbox."
"1029","Lucas","Side special","PK Fire","3% (lightning), 7% (fire)","Thrusts both of his hands forward to release a lightning bolt-shaped PSI projectile from his hands. Unlike Ness' PK Fire, Lucas' version results in a brief, fiery explosion of PSI energy that launches the opponent away, rather than a long-lasting pillar of fiery PSI energy. It is further differentiated from Ness' version in that it flies straight ahead regardless of whether it is used on the ground or in the air, as well as causing a minimal amount of recoil both on the ground and in the air, making it more effective as a spacing tool than Ness' PK Fire, but less of a combo tool."
"1030","Lucas","Up special","PK Thunder","2.5% (projectile head), 0.8% (projectile tail, rapid hits), 8% (PKT2 initial), 2% (PKT2 rapid hits 1-5), 1.5% (PKT2 rapid hits 6-10), 10% (PKT2 last)","Emits a streaming, electrical PSI projectile from his head. Like Ness' PK Thunder, it can be directed into Lucas to launch him at a high speed. Unlike Ness' version, however, it does not disappear after hitting an opponent and instead hits multiple times, giving it damage racking potential. This effect also applies PK Thunder 2, with Lucas hitting an opponent multiple times upon colliding with them. Deals immense damage if all of PK Thunder 2's hits connect, making it one of the most damaging up specials in the game. It is also a versatile recovery option if used correctly, as it covers great distance while being hard to properly counter itself due to its multi-hit and intangible properties."
"1031","Lucas","Down special","PSI Magnet","8% (ending), heals 2× the damage of absorbed projectiles (maximum 30%)","Thrusts his arm forward to emit a glowing orb of PSI energy around his outstretched hand, which comes out quicker and absorbs more damage than Ness' variant. Any energy-based projectiles it absorbs will heal him, although it no longer absorbs energy projectiles that are launched directly at his back as it did in Brawl. It can also be used offensively, due to it being safe on shield, dealing damage and having a semi-spike knockback to opponents inside of it when it dissipates. The move now has a windbox box that drags in opponents near it."
"1032","Lucas","Final Smash","PK Starstorm","6.5% (per hit)","Boney and Kumatora join Lucas, who summons a shower of falling stars that fly towards the center of the stage, damaging opponents in range. The trajectory of the meteors can be angled left and right. Unique to Lucas' version of PK Starstorm, the range of the meteors can also be adjusted. Tilting the stick up causes the meteors to spread out near the top of the screen (this will allow the meteors to hit opponents closer to the upper blast line, but will miss any who are grounded); tilting down causes the meteors to slightly angle outwards as they fall towards the stage (if done from the center of Final Destination, the meteors will cover almost the entirety). Overall, it has far more control than Ness's version."

It bounces off walls and shields. If attacked by an opponent, the ice will hurt the Ice Climbers. The ice can freeze opponents at high percents."
"1060","Ice Climbers","Side special","Squall Hammer","both: 2.2% (loop), 4% (final)","The Ice Climbers stand back-to-back while spinning around an axis with their hammers outstretched, hitting opponents multiple times. The attack is concluded with them swinging their hammers upward, which launches opponents away. By repeatedly tapping the special move button, the Ice Climbers will rise in the air, allowing them to recover. This, however, also renders them helpless. If only one Climber is present, the move deals less damage and reduced knockback, and gains less height."
"1061","Ice Climbers","Up special","Belay","16% (partner)","The leading Ice Climber throws the partner the air with a rope. The partner then pulls the leader upwards. If there is a nearby edge, the partner will target it, and then proceed to pull the leader to the ledge as well.

For the duration of the Final Smash, it can be moved left and right. The range of how far it can move is shown by the mist. The iceberg deals damage to opponents who touch it: the closer they are towards the top, the more damage they take. Towards the base of the iceberg is a Polar Bear, which has high launching power. A Condor also appears, flying above, which the Ice Climbers can grab onto. This allows the iceberg to be more easily controlled without worry of self destruction, although the partner will be at risk of potentially being pushed offstage if they fail to grab it. Upon ending, the iceberg will lower itself, and the Condor will fly off to the side of the stage."
"1064","Marth","Neutral attack","","3%/5%","Slashes Falchion twice in front of himself. The first hit's tipper pulls opponents towards Marth, ensuring that the second hit connects. The first hit can also jab lock."
"1065","Marth","Neutral attack","","4%/6%","Slashes Falchion twice in front of himself. The first hit's tipper pulls opponents towards Marth, ensuring that the second hit connects. The first hit can also jab lock."
"1066","Marth","Forward tilt","","9%/12%","A fast upward swipe while leaning forward. Has a large arc that is useful for spacing, and deals moderately strong knockback when tippered, KOing middleweights at the edge around 100%, making it a go-to spacing and KO option. Deals much weaker knockback if untippered. The tipper can hit opponents standing on top of some platforms."
"1067","Marth","Up tilt","","6% (blade), 5% (body), 9% (tip)","Swings Falchion in a large arc above his head, with a large hitbox that can hit enemies behind him. Can combo into itself or aerials at low percentages and KO at high percents when tippered. Covers platforms very well and is useful for juggling."
"1068","Marth","Down tilt","","7%/10%","A quick crouching sword poke. Marth's fastest tilt, which is useful for interrupting grounded approaches and creating space. Deals semi-spike knockback, making it useful for edgeguarding. The tipper knocks opponents into a tumble around roughly 60%, with the blade hit starting to do so around roughly 125%, which can force opponents into a tech chase situation."
"1069","Marth","Dash attack","","10% (blade), 9% (body), 12% (tip)","A quick, running, upward-sweeping diagonal slash. Low knockback, but deals decent knockback if tipped. Has notable ending lag and very low hitlag if untippered, making it rather unsafe against shields. The ability to use the faster and safer forward tilt out of dash makes this move's use rather niche."
"1070","Marth","Forward smash","Dragon Killer","13%/18%","Rotates his body counterclockwise with a strong overarching one-handed swing from his head to the ground. Moderately fast startup, but high ending lag. Although lackluster when hit with the blade, the tipper of this attack has incredible knockback, being able to KO middleweights at 75% from the stage's center and as low as 37% near the edge. The tipper is capable of 2-framing at the ledge, allowing for incredibly early KOs."
"1071","Marth","Up smash","Justice Sword","3% (ground), 13% (blade), 17% (tip)","A quick, upward thrust. The weak grounded hit can knock nearby opponents into the main attack. Good for aerial protection and chasing down landing opponents. If tippered, it deals extremely high knockback, although this is difficult to do unless an opponent falls directly on top of Marth."
"1072","Marth","Down smash","","8%/12% (hit 1), 12%/17% (hit 2)","Sweeps Falchion on the ground toward the front outward then toward the back inward. The back hit has much stronger power, while the front hit is significantly weak unless tippered, where it will do moderate knockback. It also has high ending lag."
"1073","Marth","Neutral aerial","","3.5%/5% (hit 1), 7%/9.5% (hit 2)","Two horizontal slashes around himself via an inward slash followed into a full 360° outward spin. The second hit can hit on both sides of Marth, and can be used to create space by short hopping then fast-falling immediately after using the move in the air. The first hit has very low knockback scaling, which, combined with fast falling and the move's low landing lag, allows it to combo into many of Marth's tilts, and even his forward smash, even up to around 175%. The second hit's tipper has strong knockback, KOing middleweights at the edge around 100%."
"1074","Marth","Forward aerial","","8%/11.5%","Does a descending crescent slash in front of him with great coverage. This is Marth's best tool for air combat, and its reasonably low landing lag and strong tipper make it very safe when spaced properly. Its tipper is also decently strong, KOing middleweights at the edge around 133%. Around 24% with the tipper, or around 40% with the sourspot, it begins to knock opponents into a tumble, which can force a tech chase situation."
"1075","Marth","Back aerial","About Face","9%/12.5%","An upward crescent slash behind him in an inward swipe. Has the interesting property of turning Marth around, changing the direction he is facing. Similar use to his forward aerial, although with more knockback and a smaller hitbox. Can be used a few frames before landing to catch opponents with a tipped blow, with correct spacing. Has a rather strong tipper given its speed, KOing middleweights at the edge around 100%."
"1076","Marth","Up aerial","","9.5%/13%","An overhead crescent slash with good coverage, ending in a delayed somersault. Marth's fastest aerial, it is good for juggling thanks to its large arc, making it a good anti-air as well, but it has weak knockback unless tippered. Due to its angle and low landing lag, it makes a reliable combo starter when hit with the blade, comboing into aerials even around 100%."
"1077","Marth","Down aerial","","12% (blade), 14% (non-meteor tip), 15% (meteor)","A downward, wide crescent slash with large coverage. If the attack connects at the middle of the swinging arc (directly below Marth), it serves as a powerful meteor smash. However, the meteor smash window lasts only one frame (frame 11). Can be useful against cross-ups and as an out of shield option as it starts behind Marth and covers a wide area below him."
"1078","Marth","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his free hand."
"1079","Marth","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike."
"1080","Marth","Forward throw","","4%","An elbow strike with his sword arm."
"1081","Marth","Back throw","","4%","Tosses the opponent over his leg, sending them behind him. Its high base knockback allows him to set up edgeguarding, but it cannot combo or KO reliably."
"1082","Marth","Up throw","","5%","A powerful one-armed upward throw. Marth's strongest throw, though it does not start KOing middleweights until around 185%."
"1083","Marth","Down throw","","4%","Throws opponent to the ground with one arm, bouncing them upwards. At low to mid percents, its angle and high base knockback allow it to follow up into an up or back aerial depending on DI, or only an up aerial at higher percents. Despite having low knockback scaling, it still loses its combo potential around roughly 80%-90%."
"1084","Marth","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Spins around gracefully and slashes Falchion in a circle."
"1085","Marth","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings Falchion behind, then in front of him before getting up."
"1086","Marth","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Stabs behind him, then slashes in front of himself before getting up."
"1087","Marth","Edge attack","","9%","Backflips onto the stage and slashes."
"1088","Marth","Neutral special","Shield Breaker","8%/9% (uncharged), 22%/24% (fully charged)","Marth assumes a readying stance and charges Falchion at chest level before powerfully thrusting it forward. This attack deals massive shield damage even when uncharged, and will instantly break shields at full charge, although it can be safely perfect shielded. The aerial version gives Marth a  very slight horizontal boost, while a fully charged aerial version will thrust Marth in whatever direction he's facing, giving him a strong horizontal recovery option, albeit with very high startup. Deals very high knockback when tippered, making it a powerful KOing option, especially against dazed opponents. Can be angled up or down, though this does not change the damage or knockback. The attack deals 1.15× regular damage if it hits the opponent's head, though this appears to be out-prioritized by any hitbox striking a non-head hurtbox."
"1089","Marth","Side special","Dancing Blade","Varies (see below)","A sequence of sword slashes with several variations based on directional input. Four slashes total, with each capable of being altered in direction, allowing for eighteen total possible combinations. Standard strikes are trailed red, high strikes are trailed blue, and low strikes are trailed green (see table below for details and limits of the move)."
"1090","Marth","Up special","Dolphin Slash","11% (clean), 7% (late blade), 6% (late body)","Marth performs a high-speed jumping uppercut slash that can be B-reversed. Has a powerful sweetspot and grants very slight intangibility in the first few frames, which can easily cause stage-spikes under the right circumstances. Grants good vertical distance but is rather lacking in horizontal distance. Does not snap to the edge until after its hitbox is gone."
"1091","Marth","Down special","Counter","1.2× (minimum 8%)","Marth assumes a defensive stance and retaliates against incoming attacks. The power of the counterattack scales with the strength of the attack blocked. Starts up on frame 6 and lasts 22 frames. Ineffective against projectiles and attacks with sufficiently long reach, such as many of Shulk's or Simon's tilts and smash attacks."
"1092","Marth","Final Smash","Critical Hit","60%","Marth raises Falchion skyward, then lunges in one direction, attacking the first opponent he connects. Immense knockback, enough to one-hit KO any character on any roofless stage. This move is impossible to tech unless using FS Meter or against Shulk's Shield Monado Art at very low percentage. Pressing the special button again will cause him to stop mid-dash."
"1093","Roy","Neutral attack","Slash","4.8%/7.5%","A reversed gripped upward slash. A great combo starter, due to launching at a rather high angle and having low knockback and ending lag. It can easily start combos into a grab, tilts, aerials, Double-Edge Dance or Blazer."
"1094","Roy","Forward tilt","Sharp Edge","12.5% (sweetspot), 9% (near), 8% (far)","A reversed gripped downward slash. Comes out on frame 8 with somewhat low ending lag. Very powerful for a tilt considering its speed, being capable of KOing at under 130% from center-stage when sweetspotted."
"1095","Roy","Up tilt","","7%/12%","A reversed gripped overhead arcing slash. Like forward tilt, it has remarkably good speed and power when sweetspotted, capable KOing at around 120%. However, the ending lag is quite high, making whiffs punishable."
"1096","Roy","Down tilt","Low Stab","6.5%/11%","A kneeling thrust, identical to Marth and Lucina's down tilts, but with lower range. Can set up a tech-chase due to launching at a semi-spike angle."
"1097","Roy","Dash attack","","9%/13%","An inward horizontal slash across the ground. Very strong for a dash attack, KOing at around 110% near the ledge. However, it has noticeable startup and ending lag, which makes it very unsafe on shield."
"1098","Roy","Forward smash","","20% (close), 17% (mid), 12% (far)","Rotates his body to perform a lunging, two-handed downward slash. Despite coming out rather quickly (frame 13), it has extremely high damage and knockback and is one of the strongest forward smashes in the game when sweetspotted, capable of KOing as low as 40% with max rage. However, it has high ending lag and a short duration."
"1099","Roy","Up smash","Flame Sword","2%/1% (hit 1), 2% (hits 2-4), 10% (hit 5)","An upward thrust, which ignites the Binding Blade's tip and concludes with a small explosion. A good anti-air attack as Roy's sword arm is granted intangibility throughout the attack, though mediocre for ground combat due to it having small horizontal hitboxes. Has enough power to KO at around 100% uncharged."
"1100","Roy","Down smash","","10%/15% (front hit), 11%/17% (back hit)","A kneeling outward slash in front of himself and then behind himself. Roy's fastest smash attack when it comes to startup, but has the highest ending lag of the three. The back hit is stronger than the front hit. The front and back hits KO at around 120% and 100% near the ledge, respectively."
"1101","Roy","Neutral aerial","Double Slash","4%/6% (hit 1), 5%/8.5% (hit 2),","An inward slash followed by a spinning, outward slash. Deals decent damage and is a useful combo extender, and is Roy's main aerial approach tool due to its high amount of active frames. The first hit can start guaranteed combos, though it can be difficult to setup due to how fast it ends. Interestingly, it is set apart from identical neutral aerials in that the second hit possesses fixed knockback, KO'ing characters at the exact same percentages regardless of their weight."
"1102","Roy","Forward aerial","","7%/11%","A downward slash. It comes out on frame 10 with the lowest amount of ending lag of Roy's aerials, auto-cancels from a short hop, and has KO potential at high percentages. It can also be used in quick succession due to its low ending lag, making it possible to perform a wall of pain."
"1103","Roy","Back aerial","","9%/12%","Rotates his body to perform an upward slash. Interestingly, it turns Roy around completely, similarly to Marth's and Jigglypuff's back aerials. Has great KO potential at high percentages and is also a devastating edgeguarding tool."
"1104","Roy","Up aerial","","6%/9%","A backflipping, upward arcing slash. Useful for juggling, and the sweetspot can even KO at very high percentages. The sourspot can lead into other aerials while falling."
"1105","Roy","Down aerial","Half Moon","10%/15%","A two-handed, downward slash between his legs, similar to Ike's down aerial. Has the capability to meteor smash when sweetspotted, though it can be very difficult to aim due to its slim hitbox. It's also risky to use offstage due to Roy's fast falling speed and poor recovery, possibly causing a self-destruct. This move has a flame effect."
"1106","Roy","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his free hand."
"1107","Roy","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike. A fairly fast pummel."
"1108","Roy","Forward throw","","5%","An elbow strike with his sword arm. Has very high base knockback, making it mainly used for sending opponents offstage."
"1109","Roy","Back throw","","5%","Tosses the opponent behind himself. Can set up into a KO with his back aerial."
"1110","Roy","Up throw","","6%","Heaves the opponent upward with his free hand. Roy's only throw with KO potential, starting around 170%. Can allow up aerial chains at low to mid percents."
"1111","Roy","Down throw","Slam","5%","A one-armed body slam. Roy's only combo throw and is very reliable due to the amount of followups it can potentially set up into, though, it has very low hitstun. However, it can follow up into neutral and forward aerial at low percents depending on the opponent's DI."
"1112","Roy","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Gets up while slashing to the left and then to the right."
"1113","Roy","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Gets into a kneeling position and then slices around himself as he gets up."
"1114","Roy","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Hops briskly to his feet to perform a thrust to the left and a slash to the right."
"1115","Roy","Edge attack","","8%","Performs an outward slash while climbing up."
"1116","Roy","Neutral special","Flare Blade","6%-35%, 36%-50% (fully charged), 10% recoil (fully charged)","Rears back and ignites the Binding Blade before performing a lunging, two-handed downward slash that generates an explosion. Roy can turn while charging the move. Functions similarly to Eruption, as it can be charged before unleashing the explosion, with the explosion's size growing as it charges. It has very high knockback growth even while uncharged, and the ability to quickly increase its damage output via charging. When fully charged, it will OHKO every character in the game, with the exception of Shulk in the Shield Monado Art. A fully charged Flare Blade is also capable of instantaneously breaking a full shield, similar to a fully charged Shield Breaker."
"1117","Roy","Side special","Double-Edge Dance","Varies","A sequence of sword slashes with several variations based on directional input. Four slashes total, with each capable of being altered in direction, allowing for eighteen total possible combinations. Standard strikes are trailed red, high strikes are trailed blue, and low strikes are trailed green. While identical to Marth and Lucina's Dancing Blade, its overall knockback is stronger than Dancing Blade, and the last hit of each variation deals flame damage unlike Dancing Blade because of the Binding Blade igniting. The lower-held green strikes deal a fairly large amount of damage and is useful for damaging shields, the upward blue variant is useful for setting up juggle situations, while the final forward-held hit has surprisingly high KO potential, being stronger than Cloud's Limit Cross Slash and being able to kill opponents near the ledge at lower than 80%"
"1118","Roy","Up special","Blazer","4%/5.5% (grounded hit 1), 4.5% (aerial hit 1), 1.1% (grounded hits 2-4), 1% (aerial hits 2-4), 7%/8% (grounded hit 5), 6% (aerial hit 5)","A jumping reverse gripped slash, which ignites the Binding Blade. Hits multiple times and can be angled diagonally, though this causes the slash to cover less vertical distance. The grounded version deals more knockback, and has brief super armor before Roy leaves the ground. Roy cannot sweetspot ledges with the move unless he has traveled half of Blazer's maximum distance."
"1119","Roy","Down special","Counter","1.35× (minimum 9%)","Parries and then counterattacks against any incoming attacks with an outward slash that ignites the Binding Blade. It has a 1.35× damage multiplier, the third highest of any counterattack in the game by default, with Counter Throw and Gut Check tied for second (1.5×), Tetrakarn in first (1.6×), and Vision surpassing it while the Buster Monado Art is active."
"1120","Roy","Final Smash","Critical Hit","1% (hits 1-10), 35% (hit 11)","Swings the Binding Blade in a circular motion, which ignites its blade, before performing a two-handed, downward slash that generates a powerful explosion. Unlike Marth and Lucina's Critical Hit, Roy's is not a one-hit KO unless performed at the ledge. The circular swing can hit up to four times from the front, though it can hit up to ten times if performed on an opponent behind Roy. It is based on the Binding Blade's ranged attack in The Binding Blade."
"1121","Ike","Neutral attack","","2.5%","A left-handed punch, followed by a right-legged front kick, followed by a  kneeling downward slash. The first hit can be repeated by holding the attack button. Due to three hits come out on frame 4, 3 and 5, respectively, it has the lowest amount of startup lag out of Ike's entire moveset. When coupled with its respectable damage output, moderate knockback and its last hit's impressive range, it is very useful as a close range option."
"1122","Ike","Neutral attack","","2.5%","A left-handed punch, followed by a right-legged front kick, followed by a  kneeling downward slash. The first hit can be repeated by holding the attack button. Due to three hits come out on frame 4, 3 and 5, respectively, it has the lowest amount of startup lag out of Ike's entire moveset. When coupled with its respectable damage output, moderate knockback and its last hit's impressive range, it is very useful as a close range option."
"1123","Ike","Neutral attack","","5%","A left-handed punch, followed by a right-legged front kick, followed by a  kneeling downward slash. The first hit can be repeated by holding the attack button. Due to three hits come out on frame 4, 3 and 5, respectively, it has the lowest amount of startup lag out of Ike's entire moveset. When coupled with its respectable damage output, moderate knockback and its last hit's impressive range, it is very useful as a close range option."
"1124","Ike","Forward tilt","","13.5%","A lunging outward slash. Can be angled. Its startup and ending lag are high for a tilt attack, but it has long range and deals high damage and knockback, KOing middleweights under 130% from the center of Final Destination."
"1125","Ike","Up tilt","","12% (clean), 8% (late)","Hops to thrust Ragnell upward while holding it parallel to the ground. It is overall slow for a tilt, but deals respectable damage and knockback, and its hitboxes have a long duration, which alongside its high disjointed range allows it to beat out opposing attacks from above very effectively. The clean hit can KO middleweights at around 130%, while the late hit can set up combos into a neutral, forward or up aerial at low to mid percents."
"1126","Ike","Down tilt","","8%","A kneeling inward slash. Due to it hitting on frame 7, it is Ike's fastest tilt attack. It has long range, relatively low ending lag, and launches opponents vertically with high base knockback and low knockback scaling. Altogether, these traits make it a useful combo starter into any of Ike's aerial attacks except down aerial at low to mid percents. However, it deals the least damage out of Ike's tilts, and its knockback renders it unable to KO at reasonable percents."
"1127","Ike","Dash attack","","14% (clean, body), 11% (clean, blade), 9% (late)","A lunging, two-handed upward slash. It is one of the most powerful dash attacks in the game, with its clean hit's sweetspot KOing middleweights at around 140% from the center of Final Destination. When coupled with its impressive range and its clean hitboxes' anti-rebounding priority, it is extremely useful for punishing opponents at a distance away, most notably when they are about to land. However, due to hitting on frame 15, it is one of the slowest dash attacks in the game."
"1128","Ike","Forward smash","","19% (early, clean tip), 22% (clean blade)","A lunging, two-handed downward slash. It deals impressive damage and knockback, making it one of the strongest forward smashes in the game, and hits in a wide arc that can even reach opponents above and slightly behind Ike, albeit with the early hit. Its clean hit's sweetspot can KO opponents at around 75% from the center of Final Destination. However it comes out on frame 31 and has 49 frames of ending lag, making it very difficult to hit, in addition to being highly punishable on shield. As a result, the move is unreliable to use except for hard punishes."
"1129","Ike","Up smash","","17% (clean), 10% (late)","An overhead arcing slash starting from the front. It possesses a clean hit during the arc itself, and a late hit as a shockwave when Ragnell hits the ground. Like forward smash, the clean hit boasts impressive damage and knockback; however, its slow startup at frame 25 and very high ending lag leave it very punishable. Compared to forward smash, it is noticeably weaker, with the clean hit KOing opponents at around 90%, but has less startup and ending lag, and covers a wider arc around Ike, giving it better utility in punishing landings and rolls if timed properly."
"1130","Ike","Down smash","Cast Off","16% (hit 1), 19% (hit 2, clean), 9% (hit 2, late)","A kneeling, two-handed outward slash in front of himself and then behind himself. It is Ike's fastest smash attack by a considerable margin, hitting on frame 13. The front hit is considerably weaker than Ike's other smash attacks, but still boasts respectable power, KOing opponents at around 105% from the center of Final Destination. As a result, it is Ike's most reliable smash attack overall; however, its 35 frames of ending lag still leaves it very punishable if missed or shielded. On the other hand, the back hit is slower, coming out on frame 32, and has a much weaker late hit, but its hitboxes have a longer duration, and the clean hit is far stronger, dealing impressive damage and KOing opponents at around 85%, while having less ending lag compared to the front hit."
"1131","Ike","Neutral aerial","","7.5% (clean), 6% (late)","A semi-circular slash in front of himself. It has the lowest landing lag out of Ike's aerials, and its hitboxes have a long duration, provide wide coverage around and below Ike, and launch opponents vertically. Altogether, these traits make it an infamously reliable combo starter when SHFF'd, while also being a relatively safe spacing option. It is infamous for reliably comboing into a wide variety of attacks, including neutral attack, tilts and grab at low percents, and any aerial attack (including itself) at low to mid percents. At higher percent, it can be followed up with any of Ike's aerials and eventually becomes a notoriously reliable kill set-up into up aerial near 100%, though at even higher percents this stops being the case. It deals the lowest damage out of Ike's aerials, with knockback that prevents it from KOing at realistic percents, and its long duration makes punishable if used high up in the air, as well as risky to use offstage. It is also unable to autocancel even in a full hop, requiring a double jump to do so."
"1132","Ike","Forward aerial","","11.5%","A two-handed downward slash. It covers the entirety of Ike's foreside, making it capable of hitting above and below him. Combined with its moderate startup at frame 11, landing lag and damage output, this makes it a staple for following up combos and spacing. However, its knockback has been noticeably weakened from Smash 4, rendering it unable to KO reliably except near edges, and it can no longer autocancel in a short hop, while also being risky to use offstage due to its high ending lag. As a result, Ike's neutral and back aerials are now generally superior options because of their lower lag, neutral aerial's better combo potential, and back aerial's higher damage and better power, with forward aerial's only advantages over them being its longer active frames and vertical range."
"1133","Ike","Back aerial","Repositioning Slash","14%","Quickly turns around to perform an outward slash. Due to it hitting on frame 7, it is Ike's fastest aerial. When coupled with its high damage and knockback for its speed, long horizontal range, and low landing lag, it is one of Ike's most viable approach and KO options. It can KO middleweights at around 120% from the center of Final Destination. Like the rest of Ike's aerials, however, its high ending lag prevents it from being used offstage as safely. It also has short vertical range. Ike's only aerial move that he can autocancel in a short hop."
"1134","Ike","Up aerial","Rising Swing","11%","An overhead arcing slash starting from the front. It has large coverage around Ike, low landing lag (the second lowest out of his aerials) and high knockback, allowing it to function as a highly effective juggling move. It can also set up combos into an up tilt or any of Ike's aerials (including itself) when SHFF'd, and is able to KO opponents reliably near the upper blast line at high percents. Its disadvantages are its slow startup at frame 13 and high ending lag, making it difficult to land from a neutral state; however, due to its efficiency in punishing opponents and racking up damage elsewhere, it is one of Ike's most useful moves."
"1135","Ike","Down aerial","","15%","A two-handed downward slash between his legs. The tip of Ragnell is a meteor smash, while the blade launches opponents at a horizontal angle. It is Ike's most damaging aerial and has high knockback, KOing opponents at around 125% from the center of Final Destination with its non-meteor hitboxes. The meteor smash hitbox also enables it to start combos against grounded opponents for high damage, leading into nearly any of Ike's attacks depending on the opponent's percent, and even possessing a KO setup into an up aerial at high percents. However, it has the slowest startup at frame 15 and shortest hitbox duration out of Ike's aerials, as well as poor horizontal range."
"1136","Ike","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his free hand."
"1137","Ike","Pummel","","1.6%","A headbutt. Moderately slow, but one of the most damaging pummels in the game."
"1138","Ike","Forward throw","","3.5% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","A front kick. It is a semi-spike, which makes it a reliable edgeguard setup at high percents. However, due to its high ending lag, it is unreliable for tech-chasing."
"1139","Ike","Back throw","","3% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","A spinning back kick. It is a semi-spike like forward throw, which also makes it a reliable edgeguard setup at high percents, but has less ending lag by comparison that grants it tech-chasing potential, most notably into dash attack at low to medium percents."
"1140","Ike","Up throw","","3.5% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Plunges Ragnell into the ground and then double axe handles the opponent upward. It is tied with forward throw for Ike's most damaging throw by a slight margin. It has overall weak knockback and moderate ending lag, allowing it to combo into a forward or up aerial from mid to high percents for slightly more damage compared to using down throw; however, these followups are not as reliable due to the throw's higher ending lag, while it also lacks any notable KO potential by itself."
"1141","Ike","Down throw","","3% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","A one-handed body slam followed by a knee drop. Its average base knockback, relatively low ending lag and vertical angle make it an excellent combo starter from low to mid percents, particularly into an up tilt (against larger characters), any of Ike's aerials (except down aerial), and Aether. Due to its surprisingly high knockback scaling, it is also Ike's strongest throw, KOing middleweights at around 190% without rage. As a result of this, however, its followups stop working earlier compared to up throw."
"1142","Ike","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings Ragnell around himself."

"1146","Ike","Neutral special","Eruption","10% (uncharged), 35%/28%/26% (fully charged, first pillar), 31%/25% (second pillar), 27%/22% (third pillar)","Lifts Ragnell in front of himself in a two-handed reverse grip, and plunges it into the ground to produce a pillar of blue flames. It has transcendent priority and is chargeable, causing Ragnell to become engulfed in flames that become more prominent the longer it is charged. Its impressive vertical range and respectable power even when uncharged make it useful for edgeguarding, hitting recovering opponents before they can grab the edge if timed properly. When reaching full charge level, it grants super armor and produces one additional flame pillar away from Ike, or two if held for the maximum duration, significantly increasing its horizontal range; however, it also deals 10% recoil damage to him in the process. It can KO middleweights at around 150% when uncharged, and at around 55% from center stage when fully charged. The flame pillars at full charge deal more damage the closer to their base opponents are hit. A fully charged Eruption is also capable of instantaneously breaking a full shield, similar to a fully charged Shield Breaker."
"1147","Ike","Side special","Quick Draw","6% (uncharged), 13% (fully charged)","Kneels on one knee and readies himself to charge forward. If an opponent comes in range, Ike will perform a lunging outward slash. When fully charged, the slash is strong enough to KO middleweights at around 120%. However, it has high ending lag if no opponent comes in range. In midair, it renders Ike helpless if he does not hit an opponent, but can still function reliably as an alternate recovery option due to the long horizontal distance it provides when charged, as well as its very low landing lag if timed properly."
"1148","Ike","Up special","Aether","6% (hit 1 clean), 4% (hit 1 late), 2% (hit 2), 1% (hits 3-5), 3% (descent), 6% (landing)","Performs the Sol portion of Aether, which sees Ike throwing Ragnell directly upwards, causing it to spin before he leaps upwards to grab Ragnell, perform a spinning slash, then slash downwards to land on the ground. It covers a respectable amount of vertical distance, but almost no horizontal distance. It grants super armor when initiated and until Ike begins rising, which is longer if the move is used on the ground, while all but its first hit have transcendent priority. Although it is primarily used for recovering, it can also function as a useful damage racking option when all of its hits connect due to its high total damage. The start of its descending hitbox also meteor smashes opponents, allowing it to be used for a sacrificial KO. As of the 2.0.0 update, Ike's chance of dying before the opponent during the move has been increased, making the tactic less reliable."
"1149","Ike","Down special","Counter","1.2× (minimum 10%)","Parries and then counterattacks against any incoming attacks with a reverse gripped downward slash while Ragnell is covered in blue flames. It is slow for a counterattack, activating on frame 9, and has high ending lag, but is among the strongest counterattacks in the game. Additionally, due to granting Ike full intangibility on frames 8-15, it can effectively be used to retaliate against attacks one frame before its counter window."
"1150","Ike","Final Smash","Great Aether","5% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2), 2% (hits 3-15), 5% (hit 16), 4% (hit 17), 10% (hit 18)","Performs an upward slash while Ragnell's blade is engulfed in flames. If any opponents are hit, they are launched upward and Ike throws Ragnell into the air along with them. He then leaps upward, catches Ragnell while its blade is still aflame, and unleashes a devastating series of slashes alongside a thrust, a wheel kick and a roundhouse kick. Ike then concludes the attack with a descending, two-handed slash that slams the opponent to the ground and creates a massive explosion upon impact. The explosion launches the opponent and any bystanders toward the upper blast line."
"1151","Lucina","Neutral attack","","3.325%","Slashes the Parallel Falchion twice in front of herself. The first hit can also jab lock."
"1152","Lucina","Neutral attack","","4.75%","Slashes the Parallel Falchion twice in front of herself. The first hit can also jab lock."
"1153","Lucina","Forward tilt","","11%","A fast upward swipe while leaning forward. Has a large arc that is useful for spacing. Can hit opponents standing on top of some platforms."
"1154","Lucina","Up tilt","Anti-air Slash","7.6% (early), 8.075% (late)","Swings the Parallel Falchion in a large arc above her head, with a large hitbox that can hit enemies behind her. Lucina's up tilt has a timing-based sweetspot unlike Marth's version; on the latter half of the swing, Lucina deals more damage but less knockback, allowing her to rack up damage more easily as long as she is facing away from her opponent. Covers platforms very well and is useful for juggling and starting aerial combos. It can also KO at very high percents as well."
"1155","Lucina","Down tilt","","8.5%","A quick crouching sword poke. Lucina's fastest tilt, which is useful for interrupting grounded approaches and creating space. Deals semi-spike knockback, making it useful for edgeguarding. Knocks opponents into a tumble around 80%, which can force opponents into a tech chase situation."
"1156","Lucina","Dash attack","","10.925%","A quick, running, upward-sweeping diagonal slash. Deals decent knockback, KOing middleweights at the edge around 130%. Has notable ending lag and low hitlag, making it rather unsafe against shields. The ability to use the faster and safer forward tilt out of a dash makes this move's use rather niche."
"1157","Lucina","Forward smash","","15.275%","Rotates her body counter-clockwise with a strong overarching one-handed swing from her head to the ground. Very fast startup for a forward smash, but has high ending lag. Deals considerably high knockback, KOing middleweights at the edge around 76%."
"1158","Lucina","Up smash","","3% (ground), 14.25% (blade).","A quick, upward thrust. The weak grounded hit can knock nearby opponents into the main attack. Good for aerial protection and chasing down landing opponents. It is also comparatively more reliable than Marth's, because of the positioning needed to land a sweetspot in his case."
"1159","Lucina","Down smash","","9.5% (hit 1), 14.275%} (hit 2)","Sweeps the Parallel Falchion on the ground toward the front outward then toward the back inward. The back hit is noticeably stronger than the front hit. Lucina's fastest smash attack, though it also has high ending lag."
"1160","Lucina","Neutral aerial","","4.275% (hit 1), 8.55% (hit 2)","Two horizontal slashes around herself via an inward slash followed into a full 360° outward spin. The second hit can hit on both sides of Lucina, and can be used to create space by short hopping then fast-falling immediately after using the move in the air. The first hit has low knockback scaling, which, combined with fast falling and the move's low landing lag, allows it to combo into many of Lucina's tilts, and even her forward smash, even at high percentages. The second hit has moderate knockback, KOing middleweights at the edge around 120%."
"1161","Lucina","Forward aerial","","10.5%","Does a descending crescent slash in front of her with great coverage. This is Lucina's best tool for air combat, and its reasonably low landing lag makes it very safe when spaced properly. Lucina can also use this move more reliably than Marth can, as it deals relatively high damage and knockback throughout. Around 27%, it begins to knock opponents into a tumble, which can force a tech-chase situation. KOs middleweights at the edge around 143%."
"1162","Lucina","Back aerial","","11.875%","An upward crescent slash behind her in an inward swipe. Has the interesting property of turning Lucina around, changing the direction she is facing. Similar use to her forward aerial, although with more knockback and a smaller hitbox. Safe on shield when spaced low to the ground. Rather strong given its speed, KOing middleweights at the edge around 110%."
"1163","Lucina","Up aerial","","11.4%","An overhead crescent slash with good coverage, ending in a delayed somersault. Lucina's fastest aerial, it is good for juggling thanks to its large arc, making it a good anti-air as well, and has moderate knockback. Due to its angle, it makes a reliable combo starter, especially on landing. Compared to Marth's, it loses true combo percent potential sooner due to its greater knockback compared to his equivalent move's sourspot. It can KO at very high percents near the upper blast zone."
"1164","Lucina","Down aerial","","12.35% (non-meteor), 14.25% (meteor)","A downward, wide crescent slash with large coverage. If the attack connects at the middle of the swinging arc (directly below Lucina), it serves as a powerful meteor smash. However, the meteor smash window lasts only one frame (frame 11), and the move has very high ending lag for a down aerial. Can be useful against cross-ups and as an out of shield option as it starts behind Lucina and covers a wide area below her."
"1165","Lucina","Grab","","—","Reaches out with her free hand."
"1166","Lucina","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike."
"1167","Lucina","Forward throw","","4%","An elbow strike with her sword arm. Can be used to set up edgeguards, but it is not useful for comboing or KOing."
"1168","Lucina","Back throw","","4%","Tosses the opponent over her leg, sending them behind her. Like with forward throw, its high base knockback allows her to set up edgeguarding, but it cannot combo or KO reliably."
"1169","Lucina","Up throw","","5%","A powerful one-armed upward throw. Lucina's strongest throw, which can KO at around 170%."
"1170","Lucina","Down throw","","4%","Throws opponent to the ground with one arm, bouncing them upwards. Lucina's combo throw. At low to mid percents, its angle and high base knockback allow it to follow up into an up or back aerial depending on DI, or only an up aerial at higher percents. Despite having low knockback scaling, it still loses its combo potential around roughly 80%-90%."
"1171","Lucina","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Spins around gracefully and slashes the Parallel Falchion in a circle."
"1172","Lucina","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings the Parallel Falchion behind, then in front of her before getting up."

"1174","Lucina","Edge attack","","9%","Backflips onto the stage and slashes."
"1175","Lucina","Neutral special","Shield Breaker","8.575% (uncharged), 23% (fully charged)","Lucina assumes a readying stance and charges the Parallel Falchion at chest level before powerfully thrusting it forward. This attack deals massive shield damage even when uncharged, and will instantly break shields at full charge, although it can be safely perfect shielded. The aerial version gives Lucina a very slight horizontal boost, while a fully charged aerial version will thrust Lucina in whatever direction she is facing, giving her a strong horizontal recovery option, albeit with very high startup. Can be angled up or down, though this does not change the damage or knockback. The attack deals 1.15× regular damage if it hits the opponent's head, though this appears to be out-prioritized by any hitbox striking a non-head hurtbox."
"1176","Lucina","Side special","Dancing Blade","Varies (see below)","A sequence of sword slashes with several variations based on directional input. Four slashes total, with each capable of being altered in direction, allowing for eighteen total possible combinations. Standard strikes are trailed red, high strikes are trailed blue, and low strikes are trailed green (see table below for details and limits of the move)."
"1177","Lucina","Up special","Dolphin Slash","11% (clean), 7% (late blade), 6% (late body)","Lucina performs a high-speed jumping uppercut slash that can be B-reversed. Has a powerful sweetspot and grants very slight intangibility in the first few frames, which can easily cause stage-spikes under the right circumstances. Grants good vertical distance but is rather lacking in horizontal distance. Does not snap to the edge until after its hitbox is gone."
"1178","Lucina","Down special","Counter","1.2× (minimum 8%)","Lucina assumes a defensive stance and retaliates against incoming attacks. The power of the counterattack scales with the strength of the attack blocked. Starts up on frame 6 and lasts 22 frames. Ineffective against projectiles and attacks with sufficiently long reach, such as many of Shulk's or Simon's tilts and smash attacks."
"1179","Lucina","Final Smash","Critical Hit","60%","Lucina raises the Parallel Falchion skyward, uttering ""Time to change fate!"", then lunges in one direction, attacking the first opponent she connects. Immense knockback, enough to one-hit KO any character on any roofless stage. This move is impossible to tech unless using FS Meter or against Shulk's Shield Monado Art at very low percentages. Pressing the special button again will cause her to stop mid-dash."
"1180","Robin","Neutral attack","","2%","An upward slash followed by a downward slash. The move can then proceed to a third finishing hit or into a neutral infinite, depending on whether the attack button is held or button mashed. The former is a fiery explosion, and the latter is a barrage of blade-shaped blasts of wind magic that hits multiple times and ends with a more powerful blast. Each of the third hits consume durability of the Arcfire and Elwind tomes, respectively. If both tomes are depleted, Robin will only be able to use the first two sword slashes."
"1181","Robin","Neutral attack","","1.5%","An upward slash followed by a downward slash.

"1189","Robin","Up smash","","Bronze: 9% Levin: 10% (early), 15% (clean), 10% (late)","The animation differs depending on the sword that is used: if it is the Bronze Sword, Robin thrusts it upward. If it is the Levin Sword, it will levitate out of Robin’s hand, and twirls it before raising it upward. The Levin Sword version of has great coverage, capable of hitting opponents on the ground and behind Robin. Its large hitbox also allows it to combo reliably from down throw at 0%."
"1190","Robin","Down smash","","Bronze: 8% Levin: 15% (clean), 12% (late)","Kneels and strikes the floor via a slash with the equipped sword. The Levin Sword generates brief sparks on both sides of Robin, which can hit opponents even after getting up, thus warding off punishment attempts on either side. It can also break full shield at full charge if all of its hitboxes connect."
"1191","Robin","Neutral aerial","","Bronze: 6.9% Levin: 11.5%","An inward slash forwards, followed by an outward slash backwards. If the special move and attack button are pressed (provided the A+B control setting is turned on), Robin will switch to the Levin Sword. The Levin Sword version of this move deals increased damage and covers both sides with increased range, but it cannot autocancel in a short hop. Unlike in SSB4, using neutral air will not put away the Levin Sword."
"1192","Robin","Forward aerial","","Bronze: 7.5% Levin:12.5% (clean), 5% (late)","An upward swipe. Because of its arc, it can catch grounded opponents while in the air. It has very poor KO potential with the Bronze Sword, but its knockback makes it easy to combo with, usually into itself, or other aerials."
"1193","Robin","Back aerial","","Bronze: 9% Levin: 15% (clean), 5% (late)","A backward thrust. Fast, but has a somewhat narrow hitbox which can make landing it awkward, though it still autocancels from a short hop. It can hit a few frames after ending while using the Levin Sword, which can surprise opponents."
"1194","Robin","Up aerial","","Bronze: 7.8% Levin: 13% (clean), 5% (late)","An upward overhead slash. It is a great juggling option with the Bronze Sword due to its low knockback and large arc, while it is one of Robin's most effective aerials with the Levin Sword due to its massive range and KO potential. It has lingering hitboxes with the Levin Sword."
"1195","Robin","Down aerial","Undercut","Bronze: 7.8% Levin: 11% (clean), 8% (late)","A downward slash. It also hits slightly in front of Robin. The sweetspot in the middle of the Levin Sword can meteor smash while it is swung down, while the Bronze Sword cannot meteor smash at all. The move has a lingering hitbox if the Levin Sword is used."
"1196","Robin","Grab","","—","Wraps the opponent in a whirling stream of magic. The grab's range is visualized by a halo. This halo also appears when Robin successfully grabs an opponent."

"1201","Robin","Down throw","","6%","Magically slams the opponent onto the ground, launching them vertically upward. Its knockback has been increased from the previous game, which allows for KOs below 200%. However, this removes Robin's ability to perform effective follow-ups at 100% or higher."

It is a chargeable projectile with distinct properties for each charge level: Thunder (a fast, weak, and short-ranged spark) is produced when the move is uncharged, followed by Elthunder (a stronger ball of lightning with more range) which is cast when briefly charged, then Arcthunder (a gradually accelerating and multiple hitting sphere), and finally Thoron (a long-ranged, powerful and electrical energy beam) when fully charged. Both Arcthunder and Thoron are very powerful, with Arcthunder KOing at 120% from the edge of Final Destination, and Thoron doing so at 90%. Like other chargeable moves, Robin can cancel the charge with a jump, airdodge, or offensive option."
"1207","Robin","Side special","Arcfire","2% hit 1), 1.2% (hits 2-8), 4% (hit 9)","Robin casts fire magic from a Arcfire tome. It creates a tiny fireball that travels diagonally downward from above Robin’s head and bursts into a pillar of flame on impact. It usually hits 8 times, but can hit 9 times if an opponent does not mash out of the looping hits. It is primarily useful for disrupting approaches and capitalizing on the opponent's reaction, while it can also be used for edgeguarding, either by directly attacking the opponent or covering the edge as they attempt to grab it."
"1208","Robin","Up special","Elwind","5% (first blade), 7% (second blade)","Robin casts wind magic twice from the Elwind tome, which propels Robin upwards. Elwind's projectiles can be angled, letting Robin go twice in the same direction, providing a  great horizontal recovery. If used while depleted, Robin will gain a short upward boost upward, slightly improving the chance of survival. Each wind blade generates a push effect on impact with the ground."
"1209","Robin","Down special","Nosferatu","2% (loop)","Robin casts Nosferatu on a nearby opponent to drain their health and heal Robin. Inflicts constant damage and cannot be shielded due to acting like a grab. Nearby opponents will take damage as well."

Chrom slashes the opponent upward into the air and then he and Robin relentlessly attack the opponent, with Chrom repeatedly slashing with his Falchion, while Robin casts thunder and fire magic, including Bolganone. After they finish their barrage, they perform a final simultaneous strike that spikes the opponent to the ground, which deals enough recoil to launch them towards the upper blast line. Upon successful use, all of Robin's weapons (including the ones that have yet to break) will have their durability restored."

It possesses immense reach, being the third longest reaching non-projectile forward smash in the game, only behind Simon and Richter's. It can also be angled, making it good for catching opponents trying to return to the stage when angled up or hitting crouching/small opponents when angled down. The sweetspot is at the tip and deals very high knockback, although the rest of the attack is considerably weaker. Has a hitbox while charging, where Corrin holds the Omega Yato in front of them as the chainsaw blades start to move to repeatedly damage opponents in range. Though this does not lead into the sweetspot, it can catch opponents for a fully charged blow. However, the Yato's hitbox is rather easy to SDI out of, as doing so upward can allow the opponent to avoid the main attack with a well-timed air dodge, while doing so towards Corrin will cause enemies to end up behind Corrin if close enough. Based on the second hit of the Dragon Fang skill in Fire Emblem Fates."

Animation is similar to the Mii Brawler's down smash. The tip of Corrin's spear leg has a sweetspot that deals the most damage and knockback."
"1222","Corrin","Neutral aerial","","7% (clean), 5.5% (late)","Slashes with the Omega Yato from above to behind, while simultaneously using a Dragon Fang spear to slash forwards. Unlike in Corrin's other moves, the Dragon Fang spear doesn't deal more damage at the tip. It hits all around Corrin, has low landing lag, and launches opponents at a high angle, allowing it to function as a reliable combo starter at a wide range of percents."
"1223","Corrin","Forward aerial","","7.5%","An inward single-handed reaping slash with the Omega Yato. Similar to Marth's, only with Corrin’s legs being positioned differently.

"1225","Corrin","Up aerial","","9%","Slashes in the air with the Omega Yato in a backwards flip, closely resembling the up aerials of all the other Fire Emblem characters (sans Ike, who doesn't backflip).

A stall-then-fall drill that meteor smashes weakly with set knockback, excluding the landing hit which deals moderate upwards knockback, both in the air and when landing. However, since Corrin fast-falls during the attack, it is difficult to recover offstage after using it. As a result, it works better when used for a sacrificial KO, or to quickly punish actions air-to-ground."

Holding the special button will charge the projectile (causing more damage and knockback, along with increased paralysis duration), as well as the bite (when fully charged, Corrin clamps down forcefully with the dragon mouth, causing very high damage and knockback). The two attacks can be charged in different intervals from each other (i.e. an uncharged shot followed by a fully charged bite, or vice versa)."
"1238","Corrin","Side special","Dragon Lunge","7% (lance, middle, ground), 8% (lance, middle, air), 15% (lance, tip)12% (front/back kick, clean), 7% (front/back kick, late), 5% (back kick, turn)","When used on the ground, Corrin hops a short distance into the air; pressing the attack button during the hop will result in Corrin striking diagonally down with the Dragon Fang spear arm. When used in the air, however, Corrin instantly strikes with the Dragon Fang spear arm. If it hits any terrain during the move (be it the ground or a wall), Corrin's arm will remain there, pinning any opponent caught in place. From there, it can be followed up with either a kick to either side, by pressing the attack button or tilting the control stick horizontally; or a jump by pressing the jump button or tilting the control stick upward. It can also be canceled entirely by tilting the control stick down, or automatically after pinning a surface for two seconds, which can be useful for reading the opponent's floor recovery. However, canceling the move allows the opponent to act out of it immediately. Pinned opponents can also escape by button mashing if Corrin does not choose an action soon enough. Like most of Corrin’s moves, the tip of the spear deals the most damage and knockback."
"1239","Corrin","Up special","Dragon Ascent","4.5% (hit 1), 1.2% (hits 2-6), 3% (hit 7)","Corrin grows wings using the Dragon Fang and leaps upwards. Similar to Roy's Blazer, it hits multiple times, and can be angled by approximately 45°. Additionally, like Rosalina's Launch Star, it can be angled to go as high and vertically as possible by pushing backward immediately after activation (though not too early in order to not accidentally reverse the move instead)."
"1240","Corrin","Down special","Counter Surge","1.2× (minimum 10%)","Corrin’s head goes into dragon form while getting into a defensive stance. If attacked, Corrin transforms into a dragon using the Dragon Fang, and slams the ground. A surge of water then erupts from the ground on both sides of Corrin, launching opponents upwards; a unique counter with these distinctions."
"1241","Corrin","Final Smash","Torrential Roar","7% (light pillars, base), 2% (light pillars, tips), 34% (whirlpool)","Corrin strikes with both hands, creating two large pillars of light. Anyone who gets hit will be transported to a rocky mountain area. Corrin then transforms into a dragon with the Dragon Fang, and unleashes a whirlpool that traps and launches all fighters before going back to the standard stage."
"1242","Mr. Game & Watch","Neutral attack","","3% (first and last hit)","Rapidly presses an insecticide pump, pumping gas onto the opponent. Unlike other characters, Mr. Game & Watch's rapid jab slightly pushes the opponent away. The first hit can combo into a grab or Fire at high percents; the finisher starts KOing middleweights at the ledge at around 150% on Final Destination. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into his appearance from Greenhouse."
"1243","Mr. Game & Watch","Neutral attack","","0.8% (loop)","Rapidly presses an insecticide pump, pumping gas onto the opponent. Unlike other characters, Mr. Game & Watch's rapid jab slightly pushes the opponent away. The first hit can combo into a grab or Fire at high percents; the finisher starts KOing middleweights at the ledge at around 150% on Final Destination. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into his appearance from Greenhouse."
"1244","Mr. Game & Watch","Forward tilt","","12% (clean chair), 10% (clean body), (6% (late)","Thrusts a chair forward to hit with its legs. Relatively fast for its strength (frame 8), KOing at percents around 105% by the ledge, and its hitbox lingers, making it effective at catching spotdodges. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into his appearance from Lion."
"1245","Mr. Game & Watch","Up tilt","","7% (hits 1 and 2)","Mr. Game & Watch swings a flag in front of him, and a flag behind him. The first hit knocks the opponent into the second one and has low ending lag, giving it combo potential at low to mid percents. However, it has noticeable start-up for a tilt attack, and it has poor reach both horizontally and vertically. No matter what side he faces, Flag 1 and Flag 2 will always be on the left and right sides, respectively. If this move is used twice in succession, with the second use facing the opposite as the first, the numbers (albeit being mirrored) will switch sides. The second hit KOs middleweights at around 160%. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into his appearance from Flagman."
"1246","Mr. Game & Watch","Down tilt","","9%","Pushes an angled manhole in front of himself. Does more damage than in the previous game and has much more knockback at the expense of increased endlag and reduced range. Down tilt also loses its windbox, disallowing juggling and potential recovery interrupting. The strongest down tilt in the game, with fast startup at frame 6 and killing as early as 90% by the ledge and 120% center stage. It also semi spikes leading to edge guards and potentially gimping characters with poor recovery. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into his appearance from Manhole."
"1247","Mr. Game & Watch","Dash attack","","10% (clean), 6.5% (late)","Performs a sliding headbutt while wearing a helmet. It has good range and is very fast, sliding Mr. Game & Watch forward in a choppy frame-by-frame manner, making it difficult to react to. This move is a tool for both risky approaching and safe punishing. Low ending lag, good knockback, and high amount of active frames make it a decent KOing option near the edge and useful for 2-framing opponents by the ledge. Originates from Helmet."
"1248","Mr. Game & Watch","Forward smash","","14% (handle), 18% (flame)","Swings a lit torch downward. The sweetspot is at the flame, while the sourspot is at the torch. While this move has poor startup, coming out on frame 17, it has very little cooldown and its sweetspot is safe on shield. It is also extremely strong, being comparable in knockback to Captain Falcon's Forward Smash. Its sweetspot KOs middleweights at 65% uncharged and 40% fully charged by the ledge. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model to the character from Fire Attack."
"1249","Mr. Game & Watch","Up smash","","16%","Performs an upward headbutt while wearing a diving helmet. The move has noticeable start-up, coming out on frame 21, but has an extremely low cool down of only 13 frames and a deceptively long duration of 5 frames, making it a reliable baiting tool. While his whole body gains invincibility, it only lasts during and after the move. The 12th strongest up smash in the game,  KOing middleweights at 90% uncharged and 60% fully charged. Originates from Octopus."
"1250","Mr. Game & Watch","Down smash","","13% (body), 15% (hammers)","Swings two hammers downward and on both of his sides. Has the fastest start-up of all of Mr. Game and Watch's smash attacks, coming out on frame 12, and possesses extremely fast interruptibility, ending on frame 37. It is rather disjointed for a down smash, and when sweetspoted, it will bury opponents, which can be followed up with a forward smash, down tilt, or forward tilt. Its sourspot sends opponents at a semi-spike angle and kills at 120% by the ledge. Its aerial sweetspot is one of the strongest down smashes in the game, KOing around 95%. As a result, down smash has become one of Mr. Game and Watch's most reliable KO'ing options and is arguably the best down smash in the game. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into the character from Vermin."
"1251","Mr. Game & Watch","Neutral aerial","","3% (hits 1-3), 4% (hit 4)","Tosses out a pair of fish from a bowl. Multiple hitboxes enable it to cover every area except below him. Has the fastest start-up of all of Mr. Game and Watch's aerials (frame 7), launches opponents upward, has relatively low ending lag, and has the lowest landing lag of all of his aerials. Using the move to combo into itself and/or up aerial at low percents can rack up damage percentages as high as 60%. As a result, it has become one of Mr. Game and Watch's most effective damage-racking options and is one of his primary approaching tools. Originates from Tropical Fish."
"1252","Mr. Game & Watch","Forward aerial","","3% (bomb), 12% (explosion)","Holds a bomb in front of him, dropping it downward shortly after execution. The dropped bomb acts as a projectile, as it is sent directly downwards, exploding on a half a second afterwards or when it hits the stage. As of update 2.0.0, the entirety of the explosion's radius contains the hitbox. The bomb does not explode upon hitting an opponent, and any attack that hits it will cause it to disappear. There is a weak hitbox on the bomb (shortly before Mr. Game & Watch drops it) that slightly pushes midair opponents downward that deals set knockback, disallowing it to kill at any percentage. Hitting grounded opponents with the first hit will set them up to be hit by the second. Compared to his old forward aerial, it functions more as a poking/spacing tool than an approach option. Kills at 115% by the ledge. Seems to originate from Mario's Bombs Away, Safebuster, or Bomb Sweeper."
"1253","Mr. Game & Watch","Back aerial","","2% (hits 1-3), 3% (hit 4)","Swings a snapping turtle behind himself. Has moderate start-up, but is also fully disjointed, hits multiple times, and has low ending lag; compounded with Mr. Game and Watch's high air acceleration, this makes it effective as an edgeguarding option and a spacing tool. It has high landing lag, however, making it easy to punish if not spaced well. Although it can't combo into itself anymore at higher percentages, its final hit is much stronger, making it a more reliable KO move. Originates from Turtle Bridge."
"1254","Mr. Game & Watch","Up aerial","Spitball Sparky","1.8% (hits 1-5), 3% (hit 6)","Shoots a single puff of air upward. Similar to Mega Man's up aerial, it acts as a projectile, hits multiple times, and pushes opponents upward as it rises. It has much more damage-racking and juggling capabilities than his SSB4 up aerial at the expense of losing all of its KO power. The move now has Mr. Game & Watch's model look more like his appearance in Spitball Sparky."
"1255","Mr. Game & Watch","Down aerial","","11% (key), 3.5% (landing)","Drops downward while holding a key beneath himself. A stall-then-fall, it meteor smashes powerfully on the first frames. It can be moved left or right slightly during descent. While it can potentially cause Mr. Game & Watch to self-destruct while using it off-stage, his effective recovery, coupled with its low endlag and the move being being slower than other stall-then-falls makes this unlikely. It is a safe option when edgeguarding and has KO potential at high percents, killing at 130%. Originates from the Game & Watch version of Donkey Kong Jr."
"1256","Mr. Game & Watch","Grab","","—","Mr. Game & Watch reaches in front of himself. Originates from Mario's Cement Factory. While standing grab has poor range, both his dash and pivot grabs have a massively disjointed range."
"1257","Mr. Game & Watch","Pummel","","1.3%","Hits the opponent with a bell. Originates from the Game & Watch's alarm feature."
"1258","Mr. Game & Watch","Forward throw","","8%","Juggles the opponent and tosses them forward. Has little utility beyond throwing the opponent offstage. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into the character from Ball."
"1259","Mr. Game & Watch","Back throw","","8%","Juggles the opponent and tosses them backward. Has little utility beyond throwing the opponent offstage. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into the character from Ball."
"1260","Mr. Game & Watch","Up throw","","12%","Juggles the opponent and tosses them upward. Can be followed up with up aerial at low percents or Fire at higher percents. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into the character from Ball."
"1261","Mr. Game & Watch","Down throw","","4%","Juggles the opponent and drops them on the ground behind him. Launches opponents upward. Mr. Game & Watch’s only KO throw, but still does not KO middleweights until around 200%. At low to mid percents, it's a reliable combo starter, and can be followed up with neutral air, Judge, Fire, or up air. Changes Mr. Game & Watch's model into the character from Ball."
"1262","Mr. Game & Watch","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings a hammer downward in front of himself and then behind himself. Originates from Vermin."
"1263","Mr. Game & Watch","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings a hammer downward in behind himself and then in front of himself. Originates from Vermin."
"1264","Mr. Game & Watch","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings a hammer downward in front of himself and then behind himself. Originates from Vermin."

"1266","Mr. Game & Watch","Neutral special","Chef","5% (food), 8% (frying pan)","Flips food out of a frying pan, moving slowly through the air. The trajectory can be controlled by tilting the stick forward and/or backward. By tapping the button, the food will be flung at a faster frequency. The food can be used defensively to cancel attack animations of opponents as a zoning tool as well as to prevent aerial approaches and can be used for edgeguarding against opponents with linear recoveries. Hitting with the pan itself deals flame damage, and acts as a semi-spike. Mr. Game & Watch's model changes into his appearance from Chef."
"1267","Mr. Game & Watch","Side special","Judge","Varies","Swings a hammer in front of him, and raises a flag with a random number from 1-9 with his other hand. It can have any one of 9 effects, which vary based on number; 1 only damages himself, while 9 is strong enough to be a virtual one-hit KO. Mr. Game & Watch's model changes into his appearance from Judge.
Judge 1: An extremely weak swing that does not make the opponent flinch. It is the least damaging Judge attack and deals 12% recoil damage regardless of whether or not it hits.
Judge 2: A weak swing that deals minimal knockback. It has a 20% chance of tripping the opponent.
Judge 3: A weak swing. It sends opponents in the opposite direction from where Mr. Game & Watch is facing. It deals significant shield damage.
Judge 4: A swing that has a slash effect and launches opponents diagonally forward.
Judge 5: A swing that has an electric effect and hits multiple times.
Judge 6: A swing that has a flame effect and is a semi-spike. Has the second strongest knockback of all Judge attacks.
Judge 7: A swing that deals moderate knockback and produces 3 apples if it hits the opponent. Each apple heals 4%.
Judge 8: A swing that has a freeze effect and deals very low knockback. Emits the ""ping"" sound effect that is usually associated with one-hit KOs.
Judge 9: An extremely powerful swing that deals very high knockback. It is the most damaging Judge attack and emits the ""ping"" sound effect like Judge 8. Similar in nature to a charged swing from the Home-Run Bat, but the hit's base knockback is much lower, which prevents it from being a true OHKO. When used fresh, will KO every character in the game at 0% at the edge of Final Destination."
"1268","Mr. Game & Watch","Up special","Fire","3% (trampoline; firemen), 6% (ascent)","Jumps off a trampoline and then descends while wearing a parachute.  Has the fastest start-up of all of Mr. Game and Watch's attacks (frame 3), hits behind and in front of him, and launches opponents directly upward, granting the move combo potential, even at high percents. Capable of canceling into any move when falling. Its frame 9 hitbox has KO potential at high percents near the left and right blast lines, and is very good at stage spiking, due to out-prioritizing most aerials because it being basically invincible on startup, and dealing strong knockback, making Mr. Game & Watch very difficult to edgeguard. It has become Mr. Game and Watch's most effective out-of-shield option, and is the best OoS options in the game. Originates from Fire."
"1269","Mr. Game & Watch","Down special","Oil Panic","16%-48%","Holds an oil drum, which absorbs energy-based projectiles, and reflects physical ones. Once three units are absorbed, it turns into a powerful attack consisting of Mr. Game & Watch sending out a large splash of oil from his oil drum. No matter the strength of the oil, this move will always trigger Special Zoom. A max power Oil Panic will almost certainly OHKO, while the least powerful Oil Panic can KO middleweights at the ledge around 95%. Comes out on frame 2, and with these traits Oil Panic is an incredibly dangerous move. Any opponent hit will be covered in oil for a brief moment. Mr. Game & Watch's model changes into his appearance from Oil Panic."
"1270","Mr. Game & Watch","Final Smash","Octopus","4.9% (grabbed), 15% (body), 30% (slam)","Transforms into the large octopus that appears in its eponymous game, Octopus, rears back and charges forward. The octopus can move up or down, only. Any opponents who touch its tentacles will be grabbed and dragged offscreen by the octopus, taking gradual damage. Touching the main body will just deal damage. Just like in the previous game, pressing the attack button will extend the length of the tentacles. By button-mashing, however, opponents can escape. The octopus can also go through walls and stages; any grabbed opponents who make contact with walls or floors will take damage and be launched. After reaching the blast line, Mr. Game & Watch will return back to his previous position."
"1271","Palutena","Neutral attack","","3%","Thrusts her staff forward, emitting a blast of light from its orb. While holding her staff out, she then proceeds to attack with repeated light bursts, followed by a final burst from an upward swipe. The first hit can lock. The final hit does decent knockback allowing it to function as a situational KO move. However, it is slow for a neutral attack, coming out on frame 8."
"1272","Palutena","Neutral attack","","0.6% (loop),3.5% (finisher)","Thrusts her staff forward, emitting a blast of light from its orb. While holding her staff out, she then proceeds to attack with repeated light bursts, followed by a final burst from an upward swipe. The first hit can lock. The final hit does decent knockback allowing it to function as a situational KO move. However, it is slow for a neutral attack, coming out on frame 8."
"1273","Palutena","Forward tilt","","6% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2)","Telekinetically twirls her staff in front of herself, inwards. This move can hits twice altogether if the tail of the staff hits the opponent. Its long duration and range allows it to punish sidesteps and backward rolls. The second hit has slightly more range than that of the first. However it comes out on frame 14, and its long duration and high lag makes it very punishable if missed."
"1274","Palutena","Up tilt","","1.4% (hits 1-5), 2.5% (hit 6)","Kneels down and telekinetically twirls her staff overhead. Unlike her forward and down tilts, it has KO potential due to the high knockback scaling on the last hit. It also has the lowest startup lag of her tilts, coming out on frame 8. However, its long duration and noticeable ending lag make it punishable. It also has a blindspot that makes it almost impossible to hit small or crouching characters like Kirby."
"1275","Palutena","Down tilt","","8.5% (grounded opponents), 5% (aerial opponents)","Kneels down and telekinetically twirls her staff along the ground in front of herself. A good edgeguarding and spacing tool, and can even punish sidesteps. Slow startup on frame 14 but a low 12 frames of ending lag and has a long 14 frames duration. It is one of the few moves in the game that has a longer duration than ending lag."
"1276","Palutena","Dash attack","","11% (clean), 7% (late)","Rams into the opponent with her shield. Its clean hitbox grants partial invincibility to Palutena's body and arm (frames 5 and 6 on her upper body; 7-16 on her arm). Her shield emits a shine, which indicates the duration of its hitbox. Fast startup on frame 6, although it is unsafe on shield. The clean hit has decent knockback and KOs around 160%."
"1277","Palutena","Forward smash","","16% (base), 13% (tip)","Conjures a pair of ethereal wings and flaps them forward. Great range. This move has a huge windbox near the tips of the wings that can push away opponents and potentially gimp recoveries. The tip of the wings is weaker compared to the inner part. Has quite a bit startup lag at frame 18, tied with up smash, and very high ending lag with 43 frames, making this move very punishable. Occasionally, Palutena utters ""Goddess Wings!"" when using this move."
"1278","Palutena","Up smash","","16%/12%/9% (clean, base/middle/tip), 13%/9%/7% (late)","Raises her staff skyward, conjuring a cyan beam of light that erupts from the ground in front of herself. Has the second highest vertical range of any up smash in the game, surpassed only by Snake's. The beam has three hitboxes: one at the base, one at the middle, and one at the top. It has a long-lasting 18-frame duration, and unlike her other smash attacks, has a moderate 28 frames of ending lag, making it her most reliable smash attack. However the long duration and moderate ending lag still makes it very punishable if missed or dodged and it has almost no horizontal range in front of Palutena and without covering her from directly above and behind."
"1279","Palutena","Down smash","","15% (clean), 13% (late)","Conjures a pair of ethereal wings and flaps them downward on both sides. It has very long range. Its clean hitbox has the highest knockback scaling out of her smash attacks. Much like her forward smash, huge windboxes appear near the tips of her wings and has a sourspot at the tip. Occasionally, Palutena utters ""Goddess Wings!"" when using this move. Due to coming out on frame 17 and having extreme ending lag (49 frames), it is very easy to punish."
"1280","Palutena","Neutral aerial","","1.4% (hits 1-6), 5.1% (hit 7)","Telekinetically spins her staff around herself. Has the lowest amount of startup lag in her moveset, coming out on frame 5. Notorious for its ability to effectively combo into itself and into other aerials, and especially its importance to Palutena's gameplan thanks to its low ending and landing lag. It also can easily set up an edgeguard when fast falled. Autocancels in a full hop."
"1281","Palutena","Forward aerial","","10%","A flying kick with long range. The hitbox extends beyond Palutena's leg, making it disjointed It has a generous autocancel window, doing so in a short hop fast fall and can set up edgeguards at high percents. Comes out on frame 9, but it has high ending lag and a short hitbox duration."
"1282","Palutena","Back aerial","","12%","Rotates her body to slam her shield behind her. Much like her dash attack, the clean hitbox grants invincibility around her upper body, and the duration of its hitbox is indicated by a shine. Its invincibility is brief, which is just before the hitbox first comes out (frame 7). Like her fair,it autocancels from a short hop fast fall. Has a large hitbox, but is unable to cover Palutena at point-blank range. It also has 40 frames of ending lag, making it very punishable if used poorly, so, combined with its generous autocancel window, it's better to use it in a short hop fast fall."
"1283","Palutena","Up aerial","","1% (hits 1-5), 5% (hit 6)","Twirls while emitting her halo above her. Comes out on frame 10, and is tied with down aerial for being Palutena's slowest aerial move. It has several hitboxes that grant great coverage above Palutena. It has good power and can KO reliably. Autocancels in a full hop."
"1284","Palutena","Down aerial","Purging Kick","11%","A downward roundhouse kick. Unlike most meteor smashes, it will always meteor smash midair opponents, thanks to its consistent hitbox. It is also fairly fast for a meteor smash, coming out on frame 10. Conversely, it will obliquely launch grounded opponents (grounded opponents in front of Palutena are launched behind her, and vice versa), which allows it to be used as a punishment option from out of shield when SHFF'd. However it is unarguably Palutena's worst aerial for a number of reasons. Due to it hitting on frame 10, it is tied with her up aerial for her slowest aerial. It also has the shortest range, duration, and worst autocancel window of her aerials(only autocanceling in a double jump), while its knockback is only average for a meteor smash at best. It also has immense ending lag (47 frames) which is among the laggiest aerials in the game. Additionally, it only lasts 2 frames and combined with its lack of vertical reach make it very hard to use effectively. This makes it among the hardest to land aerials in the game and as such, makes it a very high risk, but only moderate reward move with characters like Pit, Luigi and Cloud having noticeable better meteor smashes at a similar or even faster speed."
"1285","Palutena","Grab","","—","Telekinetically clinches the opponent with her staff. Palutena's overall grab range is above-average: her standing grab is the fourth-longest ranged non-tether grab in the game, while her pivot grab also has impressive range. However, her grab has a noticeable amount of ending lag."
"1286","Palutena","Pummel","","1.3%","Emits a burst of light from her staff."
"1287","Palutena","Forward throw","","9%","Slightly curls herself and then telekinetically pushes the opponent forward while throwing out her arms. It is Palutena's second-most damaging throw, but only has utility as an edge-guard set-up."
"1288","Palutena","Back throw","","10%","Telekinetically lifts the opponent and then performs an inverted version of the Arabesque (a ballet position) to fling the opponent backward. It is Palutena's most damaging throw, and her only throw that KOs at reasonable percentages. It is also useful for setting up an edgeguard."
"1289","Palutena","Up throw","","8%","Telekinetically raises the opponent upward with her left arm, and heaves them upward by thrusting her staff upward. Despite having high base knockback, its average damage output and below-average knockback scaling make it unreliable at KOing without the use of a highly elevated platform, while its ending lag makes it unfavorable as a combo starter. As a result, it is better suited for setting up aerial pressure."
"1290","Palutena","Down throw","","5%","Telekinetically lifts the opponent, then slams them onto the ground. It is Palutena's most useful throw, thanks to its high base knockback, very low knockback growth, and diagonal launching angle. Depending on the opponent's DI, it can combo into any of her aerials."
"1291","Palutena","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings her staff behind herself and then in front of herself before getting up."
"1292","Palutena","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Same as her frontal floor attack."
"1293","Palutena","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings her staff in front of herself and then behind herself before getting up."
"1294","Palutena","Edge attack","","9%","Performs a legsweep while climbing up."
"1295","Palutena","Neutral special","Autoreticle","3.5% (per shot)","Illuminates her staff's orb to aim a reticle over the opponent, and then fires three energy blasts at that location. It will only fire the blasts if nothing blocks her target, and if the opponent is within range and not intangible. The shots can lock, although due to the changes on locking, it has even less use to initiate combos. It can be used as a way for stopping direct approaches and to force an approach. It is also able to hit opponents behind Palutena, such as if she is moving when it fires and if the opponent is at the maximum horizontal range toward her. Although situational, it also has very minor recovery potential, thanks to it briefly stalling her descent. However, it has high ending lag, regardless of whether or not it targets anything. Its very minor knockback also makes it poor for spacing."
"1296","Palutena","Side special","Explosive Flame","1.5% (hits 1-6), 5.5% (hit 7)","Creates a multi-hitting explosion approximately 4 character lengths away from herself. If inputted like a smash attack, the explosion hits approximately 7.5 spaces away. The ability to change its range makes it a decent spacing and zoning tool, as well as an edge-guarding option. This move has good KO potential, thanks to its loop hits reliably trapping the opponent, and its last hit having impressive knock back. However it is very punishable if missed and can be shielded."
"1297","Palutena","Up special","Warp","0%","Disappears and then reappears in a chosen direction. It quickly covers both a respectable amount of vertical distance and a decent horizontal distance while rendering Palutena invisible (frames 16-32). It can also be edge-canceled, which grants it defensive and re-positioning potentials. However, it renders Palutena helpless after she reappears, unless it is edge-canceled and lacks a hitbox to protect her."
"1298","Palutena","Down special","Counter/Reflect Barrier","1.3× countered attack/1.4× reflected projectile","Palutena uses her shield to catch an opponent's attack. If a physical attack connects, Palutena will forcefully thrust her staff out, creating a blast of light. If a projectile attack connects, she raises her shield to emit a rectangular barrier that reflects the projectile."
"1299","Palutena","Final Smash","Black Hole Laser","40.8% (maximum damage)","Illuminates her staff's orb and twirls around repeatedly before firing a Black Hole from her staff's orb, after which she quickly retreats off-stage in order to fire a Mega Laser into the Black Hole. The Black Hole does not deal damage, but pulls the opponent into itself and places them in a tumbling state. Conversely, the Mega Laser hits multiple times before concluding with a final blast that launches the opponent and dissipates the Black Hole."
"1300","Dark Pit","Neutral attack","","2%","A reverse gripped downward slash, followed by a reverse gripped inward slash, then by an upward slash. If button mashed, Dark Pit will instead follow up the second slash with a flurry of slashes using both blades, which concludes with a lunging outward slash."
"1301","Dark Pit","Neutral attack","","2%","A reverse gripped downward slash, followed by a reverse gripped inward slash, then by an upward slash. If button mashed, Dark Pit will instead follow up the second slash with a flurry of slashes using both blades, which concludes with a lunging outward slash."
"1302","Dark Pit","Neutral attack","","4%","A reverse gripped downward slash, followed by a reverse gripped inward slash, then by an upward slash.

"1303","Dark Pit","Neutral attack","","0.5% (loop), 2% (last)","A reverse gripped downward slash, followed by a reverse gripped inward slash, then by an upward slash. If button mashed, Dark Pit will instead follow up the second slash with a flurry of slashes using both blades, which concludes with a lunging outward slash."
"1304","Dark Pit","Forward tilt","","7% (base), 10% (tip)","Arcs his body forward to perform a scissoring slash. It is decent for spacing and possesses above average power for a tilt attack, with its sweetspot KOing middleweights at around 150% from the center of Final Destination. Due to it hitting on frame 10, however, it is Dark Pit's slowest tilt attack, and its base hitboxes KO significantly later due to their lower damage output. Overall, it is one of Dark Pit's most situational attacks."
"1305","Dark Pit","Up tilt","Anti-air Attack","4% (hit 1), 5% (hit 2)","Two alternate lunging kicks upward. Compared to Smash 4, where it was nearly useless due to its short range, high ending lag and lack of combo or KO potential, its much more favorable ending lag and knockback in Ultimate allow it to combo reliably into a neutral aerial or up aerial, even up to high percents."
"1306","Dark Pit","Down tilt","","6%","A kneeling outward slash. Its minimal startup and low ending lag make it Dark Pit's best grounded spacing option, and it launches at a vertical angle, allowing it to combo into a dashing up smash at low percents, and a neutral, forward or up aerial from low to mid percents."
"1307","Dark Pit","Dash attack","","11%","A spinning inward slash. Its fast startup, long range and respectable damage output make it excellent for punishing landings, while it also possesses enough knockback to KO at high percents, starting at around 160%. However, like other dash attacks, its moderate ending lag makes it punishable on shield."
"1308","Dark Pit","Forward smash","","5% (hit 1), 10% (hit 2)","Performs a reverse gripped inward slash with a blade, then quickly reassembles the Silver Bow in order to perform an outward slash with the Silver Bow. Its first hit has low set knockback to connect reliably into its second hit. Due to hitting on frame 10, it is also one of the fastest forward smashes in the game. The second hit can KO middleweights at around 120% from the center of Final Destination."
"1309","Dark Pit","Up smash","","3% (hit 1), 2% (hit 2), 8% (hit 3)","Jumps to perform three upward slashes. It hits on frame 6, making it one of the fastest smash attacks overall. It is also a useful anti-air attack due to its long vertical range and disjointed hitboxes. However, it conversely possesses short horizontal range, resulting in it hitting grounded opponents only if they are at point-blank range in front of Dark Pit."
"1310","Dark Pit","Down smash","","12% (base), 10% (tip)","Performs a kneeling outward slash with a blade, followed by a squatting reverse gripped thrust behind himself with the other blade. Its sweetspot is located at the base of each blade. Like Dark Pit's other smash attacks, it is among the fastest of its kind, hitting on frame 5. While the first hit has higher base knockback and both hits have equal knockback scaling, the back hit's sweetspot KOs earlier thanks to its semi-spike angle."
"1311","Dark Pit","Neutral aerial","","0.7% (hits 1-7), 4.5% (hit 8)","A buzzsaw-like series of slashes in front of himself. It hits multiple times, with its last hit having high knockback scaling. It has the fastest startup out of Dark Pit's aerials (hitting on frame 4), long lasting hitboxes, and autocancels in a short hop quickly after the hitboxes cease, making it useful for approaching, edgeguarding, and canceling out weak projectiles."
"1312","Dark Pit","Forward aerial","","2.5% (hits 1-2), 6% (hit 3)","Lunges forward to perform a buzzsaw-like series of slashes that hit up to three times. The last hit has high knockback scaling, KOing middleweights at around 175% from the center of Final Destination, and at around 130% at the edge, making it useful for edgeguarding at high percents. Like neutral aerial, it also autocancels quickly in a short hop, but has comparatively longer horizontal range, so it is a safe approach option. However, it has moderate startup lag and minimal vertical range."
"1313","Dark Pit","Back aerial","","12% (tip), 8% (base)","A double reverse gripped thrust. It has a sourspot at the base of Dark Pit's blades that launches vertically with weak knockback, allowing it to combo into several grounded moves and aerials (including another back aerial) from low to mid percents on landing. Conversely, the tip of the blades possess a sweetspot that launches horizontally with the highest knockback out of Dark Pit's aerials, KOing at around 135% from center stage, and making it one of Dark Pit's most reliable KO options. However, the sweetspot can be difficult to land due to having lower priority than the sourspot, as well as the move's moderate startup lag."
"1314","Dark Pit","Up aerial","","1.5% (hits 1-4), 5% (hit 5)","An overhead, buzzsaw-like series of slashes. It hits multiple times, with its last hit launching vertically. Combined with the long duration of its hitboxes, this allows it to function as a reliable juggling tool. With proper timing and spacing, it can also hit characters on the ground upon landing and start combos, much like his back aerial's sweetspot. However, its moderate startup and long total duration make it punishable if used high up from the ground and missed."
"1315","Dark Pit","Down aerial","Under-Arc Slash","10%","A downward arcing reverse gripped slash. It has a sweetspot on the first hit frame that is a meteor smash, while its fairly long range and ability to autocancel in a short hop allows it to function as an approach option. It also has the fastest total duration out of Dark Pit's aerials, and its non-meteor hitboxes launch opponents vertically, allowing it to combo into other aerials from low to mid percents. While its meteor smash is relatively weak, it is among the fastest, coming out on frame 10."

"1319","Dark Pit","Back throw","","8%","Grabs the opponent by their head, spins around with them in tow, and them slams them onto the ground headfirst. Besides setting up edgeguards, it can combo into a dash attack at low percents, or act as a setup into Silver Bow at mid to high percents."
"1320","Dark Pit","Up throw","","4% (hit 1), 7% (throw)","A handstand kick, similar to Sheik's up throw. It is Dark Pit's most damaging throw, but its throw hitbox's average base knockback and knockback scaling make it unsuited for KOing or combos. As a result, its only utility is dealing damage and initiating aerial pressure alongside Silver Bow."
"1321","Dark Pit","Down throw","","2% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Pins the opponent to the ground and then slashes their back. It is Dark Pit's best combo starter, as it can combo into a dashing up smash at low percents, and into any of Dark Pit's aerials except down aerial until high percents."

"1326","Dark Pit","Neutral special","Silver Bow","5.5% (uncharged), 14% (fully charged)","Shoots a purplish-black arrow from his bow. Can be slightly angled up or down while flying and can be aimed up while charging. The arrows deal considerably more damage and knockback than Pit's, and are slightly faster, although they cannot be curved as strongly. This makes them significantly less effective for gimping and edgeguarding, but more effective as a conventional projectile."
"1327","Dark Pit","Side special","Electroshock Arm","12% (grounded), 9.5% (aerial), 1× (reflected projectiles)","Wields the Electroshock Arm to perform a dashing uppercut. It grants super armor during the dash, and reflects projectiles at roughly 45°. However, it is an overall laggy attack, especially if missed; the aerial version in particular has a total duration of 104 frames (roughly 1.73 seconds), leaving Dark Pit prone to self-destructs if used below ground level. Nevertheless, it can aid his recovery, as it is capable of sweetspotting edges and can still allow him to get back to the stage if he has enough jumps left. Compared to Pit's Upperdash Arm, Electroshock Arm has an electric effect, deals more damage, and launches opponents horizontally instead of vertically, allowing it to KO earlier near edges; however, its lower knockback values make it weaker from center stage, with the grounded version KOing middleweights at around 125% instead of 110%."
"1328","Dark Pit","Up special","Power of Flight","—","Soars through the air by using the Power of Flight. It covers a significant amount of distance, and the flight's direction can be angled in any way except downward, making it capable of being a purely vertical and nearly horizontal recovery option. It also grants intangibility on frames 9-19 when used on the ground, and on frames 15-19 when used in the air. Due to its high landing lag and lack of hitboxes, however, it leaves Dark Pit more vulnerable than other recoveries, especially if he does not grab an edge."
"1329","Dark Pit","Down special","Guardian Orbitars","1.5× (reflected projectiles)","Wields the Guardian Orbitars to create twin energy shields that protect his left and right sides. They reflect projectiles with 50% more power and 70% more speed than they originally had, and can block physical attacks. However, they have 15 HP for physical attacks, with 0.07 HP regenerated every frame (4.2 HP per second), and break if it is fully depleted, after which they require 10 seconds to regenerate. Guardian Orbitars also push away opponents who are near Dark Pit when he wields them, which makes them capable of edgeguarding. In the air, Dark Pit can drift while using them, even if they are broken. Guardian Orbitars have a minimum duration of 20 frames (0.33 seconds) and a maximum duration of 100 frames (1.66 seconds). However, they leave Dark Pit open to attacks from above and below him, and they gradually shrink in size as they are held out."

"1365","Wario","Up tilt","","6% (clean), 5% (late)","Wario thrusts his outstretched hands upwards. Provides little knockback but is a potent combo starter, linking into many aerials and most notably, can confirm into Wario Waft.

Possibly based off of Wario's victory animation in Wario Land II upon unlocking Time Attack mode."
"1366","Wario","Down tilt","","4%","Wario violently pokes the ground with his index finger, damaging opponents as he does so. Provides very little knockback and can combo into aerials and ground moves, most notably Dash Attack. Also provides disjoint due to the hands lacking a hurtbox, altough the hitbox itself is very narrow and can miss opponents that are even slightly above it.  Likely based on the ""Touch"" themed microgames from the WarioWare series."
"1367","Wario","Dash attack","Shoulder Tackle","11% (clean), 5% (late/early, body)","Wario performs his signature ""Shoulder Tackle"" dash attack from the Wario Land series. A powerful kill move with an extremely short startup at frame 5. The late hit is weaker, but launches opponents at an upward angle, where Wario can potentially follow up with a juggle situation. The early hit has a sourspot inside Wario's body that is hard to hit and deals 5%."

Has high endlag and the slowest startup of Wario's smash attacks, but is extremely powerful. The winding back can allow moves to whiff, thus being punished by the attack. Due to coming out on frame 18 and having 46 frames of ending lag it is very punishable if missed."
"1369","Wario","Up smash","","17% (early), 13% (late)","A hard hitting, arcing headbutt. Wario's head enlarges significantly during the attack and extends upward, and has head intangibility, making it very disjointed. The attack has high launching power and covers a fair amount of both vertical and horizontal range, but has a comical amount of endlag with 45 frames, to the point where Wario would be standing and still be in lag. May be based on the third hit of his basic attack combo in Wario World."
"1370","Wario","Down smash","","13% (early), 10% (late)","Spins on the ground thrice, bashing foes with his head. The move consists of three hits, though only one hit can connect. The first hit is capable of KO'ing at high percents while subsequent hits are much weaker.

Very fast startup. The attack has two separate hitboxes that act independently from each other. Both hits can combo into each other at low percents and Wario can act just 4 frames after the hitboxes cease. The late hit can lead into another aerial and even Wario Waft. Visually similar to Wario's crouch-jump from Virtual Boy Wario Land and Wario Land: Shake It!."
"1372","Wario","Forward aerial","","7% (clean), 4.5% (late)","A quick kick forwards. The first few frames do more damage and knockback. Very low knockback, but starts up very fast, making it useful for gimping or escaping pressure, as well as being a decent poking tool. The late hit can lock and also combos easily into other aerials at low percents. It autocancels in a short hop."
"1373","Wario","Back aerial","","12%","Wario propels his head backwards. A viable KO move as it is his strongest aerial knockback-wise. Also has relatively low startup and sends at a somewhat low angle, but it has high ending lag. Autocancels if used at the peak a short-hop."
"1374","Wario","Up aerial","Hand Slap","13%","Wario claps his hands and feet together in mid-air. His strongest aerial damage-wise with the best vertical knockback as well. A potent combo starter. If used after a fastfall, it can lead into an aerial and Wario Waft at low-mid percent. Also possesses disjoint due to the hands not having a hurt box. Fast for its power, coming out on frame 8, but has 38 frames of ending lag, which can make  it punishable."
"1375","Wario","Down aerial","","1.3% (hits 1-6), 4% (hit 7)","Wario puts his hands above his head and spins while upside down, drilling with his hands and head. The last hit has powerful diagonal knockback that can KO at high percents. When landing with it before the final hit, it can often lead into a half waft. If the move fails to connect into the subsequent hits, it can also weakly meteor smash the opponent, although it cannot get stronger due to its set knockback.

Grabs the opponent by the legs, spins them around three times and launches him/her behind himself, damaging those who come in contact with the spin, which can be good for getting opponents away if in a match with more than 2 characters."
"1380","Wario","Up throw","","4% (throw), 4% (collateral)","Wario tosses the opponent up and punches them upwards with enlarged fists. Can link into up airs at low and low-mid percents."
"1381","Wario","Down throw","","7% (throw), 4% (collateral)","Throws the opponent on the ground and slams them with his rear end.

Has a long range and very fast startup. It can be used to consume items and projectiles, healing 1% damage from items, and a third of the damage by a projectile's base damage. Eating explosives will cause them to detonate inside of Wario, harming him, but the explosion will damage nearby foes. Healing items consumed with Chomp heal 1.5x more damage than normal. Consuming items lessens the time necessary to charge the Wario Waft. Based on the Hot Dog Hog microgame from the WarioWare series and the Hyper Suction move from Wario World."

Tilting the opposite direction on the ground will make him turn around, dealing damage and killing at high percents, and tilting in the air can adjust the angle of the Wario Bike and his jump afterwards. Holding up will produce a wheelie, and pressing down during a wheelie makes the bike perform an extremely powerful ground slam. After dismounting the bike, Wario can destroy it, throw it at opponents, or eat it with Chomp. When thrown, the Wario Bike can launch opponents a  fair distance, even KO'ing them at high percents. In the air, the bike gives a small initial vertical hop along with a free jump via dismounting it. After losing the Wario Bike, Wario cannot summon another bike for 6 seconds, and until he touches the ground again. If the player tries to do so before the cooldown ends or a Bike is already out, not within his reach, Wario will instead, look helplessly around the stage for his bike. The look animation can be cancelled if landing on the ground after initiating it in the air."
"1388","Wario","Up special","Corkscrew","5% (first hit), 1%-1.5% (hits 2-5), 4% (final hit)","Wario launches himself into the air, hitting enemies multiple times while spinning. The final hit has decent diagonal knockback with the hands, KO'ing at high percents. Wario's body has a hitbox that launches up, although is very difficult to hit due to the hand hitboxes taking priority.The move can be steered diagonally left or right. Possibly based on the Corkscrew Conk from Wario World. While both moves feature vertical ascension, the two moves are different visually."

Its charge cannot be lost in any way without using the move itself. By Chomping items, the Wario Waft charges faster by 1.5 seconds. There are 4 levels of charge, all with varying effects: at no charge, the waft will always trip opponents but deals no damage and is the slowest waft (frame 16), the second level is the the second slowest (frame 10), the third level (half-charged) is the fastest (frame 5) and has good KO potential, and the fully charged waft deals the most damage and knockback, has a huge hitbox and armor (frame 5-10), and also sends Wario flying upwards with a headbutt that has equally powerful KO potential, although is slower than the third level of charge (frame 9)."

If the move connects, Wario transforms into the masked anti-hero, Wario Man from the WarioWare series and splits himself into multiple copies, dealing a series of blows to opponents caught into the attack. The final blow is delivered by an explosive fart that launches the opponents, KO'ing them at mid to high percents. The strength of the final fart is not affected by the charge of Wario's down special."

It is good for starting combos into itself, up smash and up aerial from low to medium percentages, or functioning as an anti-air attack. However, it has very minimal horizontal range, which forces R.O.B. to practically stand next to a grounded opponent in order to land it."
"1425","R.O.B.","Down tilt","","5%","Thrusts his arms low along the ground. It hits on frame 3, which ties it with neutral attack as R.O.B.'s fastest attack. Although it has a small chance to trip opponents, its overall fast speed largely offsets this and makes it an excellent set-up option."

"1427","R.O.B.","Forward smash","S3","15% (base), 11.5% (middle), 6% (tip)","An optical energy blast, similar to the uncharged Robo Beam. It can be angled; has very high knockback growth; and its base hitbox deals respectable damage. Altogether, these enable it to KO middleweights at 109% near the edge. Although slightly weaker, its middle hitbox is still strong enough to KO middleweights at 136% near the edge. However, its range is merely average at best, it has high ending lag and the blast's tip has extremely minimal KO potential."
"1428","R.O.B.","Up smash","","3% (hit 1), 14% (hit 2)","Performs a handstand and activates his thrusters to emit a fiery blast upward. It hits on frame 10, which is somewhat fast for a smash attack. It also has deceptive horizontal range on the ground, thanks to R.O.B.'s arms having hitboxes that launch opponents into the thrusters' hitboxes, the latter of which are fairly powerful. Its base KOs middleweights at 113%, whereas its tip KOs them at 116%. Altogether, these traits make it a reliable KOing option, especially from out of shield. However, it has high ending lag."
"1429","R.O.B.","Down smash","","3.5% (hits 1 and 2), 5% (hit 3)","Lowers his torso and spins it around rapidly while outstretching his arms to perform a series of discus clotheslines, similarly to Arm Rotor. It hits on frame 7, which is very fast for a smash attack. Thanks to it being a semi-spike and its last hit's very high knockback growth, it KOs at middleweights at 129% while near the edge, and is very effective for edge-guarding. However, its base hitboxes launch the opponent behind R.O.B., which means that he must face away from the edge when attempting to use this move in order to properly launch the opponent off-stage. Like forward and up smash, it also has high ending lag."

Its large hitbox, very minimal landing lag and ability to auto-cancel with a short hop collectively make it very useful for spacing, approaching and starting combos. Due to it hitting on frame 14, however, it is one of the slowest of its type and is punishable if it is not spaced properly."
"1431","R.O.B.","Forward aerial","","7%","A double forearm club. It hits on frame 6, making it R.O.B.'s fastest aerial. It is also ideal for spacing when SHFF'd, has minimal landing lag and is decent for edge-guarding. However, it lacks KO potential because of its average damage output and very low base knockback. It is also R.O.B.'s only aerial that does not have a disjointed hitbox."

Very high power, but is very slow, coming out on frame 18 and has several sourspots. It also is unable to autocancel in a short hop. Back aerial can also be used for horizontal recovery, as it slightly propels him forward and does not consume Robo Burner's fuel."
"1433","R.O.B.","Up aerial","","1.5% (hits 1 - 4), 4% (hit 5)","Rapidly rotates his arms upward, ending it with an upward double forearm club. It hits on frame 7, making it R.O.B.'s second fastest aerial. It is down throw's most reliable follow-up from low to medium percentages. It is also useful for juggling and KOing, as its loop hits keep the opponent trapped reliably, whereas its last hit's extremely high knockback growth enables it to KO middleweights at 115% while near the upper blast line. It can also auto-cancel with a short hop."
"1434","R.O.B.","Down aerial","","12% (base), 11% (middle), 6% (tip)","Activates his thrusters to emit a fiery blast downward. The middle portion of the blast is a powerful meteor smash, which makes it a very potent edge-guarding option, especially after an edge trump if the opponent re-grabs the edge.  Auto-cancels in a short hop due to it stopping R.O.B's momentum. Due to it hitting on frame 20 and having 43 frames of ending lag, it is R.O.B.'s slowest aerial. When coupled with its 12 frames of landing lag, it is punishable if it is not spaced properly and auto-canceled, though not to the same extent as in SSB4."

Uncharged Robo Beam is a very small energy blast instead of a laser, and can only damage opponents at point-blank range. However, it can be fired consecutively and has deceptively high knockback growth, which allow it to ward off nearby opponents. Conversely, both Robo Beam and Super Robo Beam can damage opponents from afar and ricochet, but cannot be fired consecutively. Robo Beam and Super Robo Beam also deal noticeably more damage when fired at point-blank range. It is one of R.O.B.'s options for zoning alongside Gyro, with Robo Beam being better for his neutral game, while Super Robo Beam is better for surprising opponents.
The light on R.O.B.'s head indicates the level: a dim, slow-paced pulsating glow indicates an Uncharged Robo Beam; a brighter, moderate-paced pulsating glow indicates Robo Beam; and a bright, rapid-paced pulsating glow indicates Super Robo Beam."
"1446","R.O.B.","Side special","Arm Rotor","1.5% (loop), 3% (final hit)1.5× reflected projectile","Rapidly spins his torso around to perform a series of discus clotheslines that concludes with an uppercut. Mashing the special button extends the duration of the move. It can also reflect projectiles and move R.O.B. forward or backward while the control stick is tilted in the respective direction."
"1447","R.O.B.","Up special","Robo Burner","0%","Activates his thrusters in order to fly. It grants impressive vertical and horizontal recovery distance, although R.O.B. has a set amount of fuel, indicated by the gauge in his chassis, to use in order to perform this move. Fuel is recovered over time as long as R.O.B. is grounded. This doesn't cause helplessness, allowing R.O.B. to fast fall, air dodge, or attack with any aerials or any of his other specials either through its duration or after its conclusion. R.O.B. is also immune to footstool jumps while using this move, although other characters can still jump off of him regardless. It also grants intangibility on frames 2-4, but only when performed on the ground."
"1448","R.O.B.","Down special","Gyro","6.1%-8.7% (uncharged), 7.2%-10.8% (fully charged), 5% (idle Gyro)","Charges a spinning top on his base. R.O.B.'s other zoning option alongside Robo Beam, it can be picked up and thrown as an item after making contact with either the opponent or the stage. However, opponents can do the same and thus use the top against him. Only one Gyro can be active at a time, and attempting another will result in R.O.B. flailing in confusion. If R.O.B. is holding his Gyro, he will be able to charge it again. Typically, an idle Gyro deals little knockback when touched, (albeit enough to harass anyone trying to get past), but it can lock."
"1449","R.O.B.","Final Smash","Guided Robo Beam","1.2% (homing lasers), 1% (laser loop), 3% (enlarged laser loop)","Re-configures his body into a cannon-like form, and begins to charge energy. During the charge, he fires smaller red lasers that home on opponents in front of him. He then unleashes the built up energy in the form of a green laser, which can be angled up or down. As the Final Smash begins to end, the laser briefly enlarges, becoming wider and more powerful."
"1450","Villager","Neutral attack","","1% (loop), 2% (final hit)","A quick series of alternating punches with boxing gloves that ends with a strong straight jab at the end. It no longer jab cancel because of the new finisher. However it can rack up a great amount of damage quickly."

Hits twice, with very long duration and the second hit having vertical knockback that can KO at high percentages. Both hits can hit opponents on either side of the Villager."
"1453","Villager","Down tilt","","12% (weed), 10% (shockwave)","Pulls a weed out of the ground, knocking foes upwards. Decently fast, coming out on frame 9. Like up tilt, it hits hard for a tilt of its speed, being able to KO at high percentages. Has deceptively long disjointed range, though it is strongest close up."
"1454","Villager","Dash attack","","10% (clean), 6% (late)","Falls over and drops a potted sapling, which flies a short distance. The pot will either shatter instantly upon hitting the ground, or it will bounce off the ground once. Its hitbox disappears if the latter happens, causing the potted sapling to deal no damage after the bounce. The pot deals less damage if it hits the opponent while it flies, but this gives the move a good range. It can be dropped from ledges to allow it to fly further, making for a possible edgeguarding option. However, the potted sapling will disappear after traveling a set distance."
"1455","Villager","Forward smash","Bowling Ball","15% (early), 17% (clean)","Leans forwards and drops a bowling ball. Is safe on shield and has enough knockback to KO reliably around 95% (60% fully charged). However, it has poor horizontal range and noticeable startup as well as high endlag. Notably, the ball can fall off edges if the Villager stands near one, making it great for edge-guarding if the opponent recovers low. The bowling ball does slightly more damage and knockback if it falls a certain distance before hitting opponents. However, as the bowling ball is considered a projectile, it can be reflected even at point blank range."
"1456","Villager","Up smash","","3% (hit 1), 1% (hits 2 - 5), 4% (hit 6)","Detonates a fountain firework, creating an explosion above themself. Has a fairly large hitbox and pulls opponents to the center of the blast, although it does not always connect properly and opponents can be knocked out of the move by any of the first few hits, especially at very high percentages. It can KO most characters at about 120%."
"1457","Villager","Down smash","Dig","6% (clean), 3% (further opponents on the ground)","Takes out a shovel and digs in front, then behind himself. Fast startup for a smash attack, making it a decent out of shield option. It can bury grounded opponents; opponents in the air instead have weak knockback inflicted to them. This is the only smash attack in the series that cannot KO when grounded. Has moderate ending lag, and it can follow-up into Village's strongest attacks like forward smash if the opponent is at high percentages."
"1458","Villager","Neutral aerial","","9% (clean), 5% (late)","Does a cartwheel. Acts as a decently long sex kick that deals good knockback in the first frame. Has very fast startup (hits on frame 3), allowing Villager to use it as an extremely safe out-of-shield option and combo breaker, and the length of time its hitbox stays out also gives Villager a lot of protection."
"1459","Villager","Forward aerial","","7% (clean), 4% (mid), 2.5% (late)","Fires a slingshot pellet that travels slightly less than half the length of Final Destination. The pellet deals low knockback and deals even less knockback if hit in the final frames, similar to Mega Man's neutral air. The pellet deals moderate knockback at point blank range, which is deadly especially offstage."
"1460","Villager","Back aerial","","9% (clean), 5% (mid), 3% (late)","Like the forward aerial, but aimed backwards. Slightly slower startup, but deals more knockback and damage compared to his forward aerial.

Same damage values as up aerial, and is also a sex kick. It comes out slightly slower but is still quite fast. A clean hit any amount of turnips can meteor smash if the ends of the turnips hit the opponent; the early hits of the turnip that do not meteor instead have high horizontal knockback. The late hit can be used to initiate combos (such as into neutral attack, forward tilt, and almost any projectile Villager might have pocketed) if he hits it while landing, due to the small amount of horizontal knockback from the sex kick even at very high damage. May trip opponents at low percents if hit clean."
"1463","Villager","Grab","Net","—","Traps opponents in a net with an overhead swing. Long range, but has considerable startup and noticeable ending lag, making it punishable if missed. Villager can also pocket items using the net."

"1466","Villager","Back throw","","11%","Turns around swinging his net horizontally.One of the strongest back throw in the game, KOing even the heaviest characters reliably at around 153% without rage and with optimal DI from the opponent. It's also very effective for edgeguards due to its altered knockback."
"1467","Villager","Up throw","","10%","Flips net over and tosses opponent upwards. Good for juggling."
"1468","Villager","Down throw","","6%","Turns net horizontally and slams it into the ground. Knocks opponent upwards. Can combo into a forward tilt at very low damage on most characters as well as aerials from low to mid percentages. A good way to combo into a pocketed projectile."

Villager can choose to ride on it, which increases the damage and knockback dealt. Using the move in this fashion leaves Villager helpless unless the rocket explodes from hitting an opponent or damageable object. Additionally, if the Lloid hits a wall, runs out of fuel, or is hit by a strong enough move, it will explode much more powerfully than normal, dealing high flame damage and knockback. This fiery explosion can kill quite early, even on heavy characters."
"1475","Villager","Up special","Balloon Trip","0%","Villager puts on a hat with two balloons (both of a set color determined by the player's number) attached to it. Pressing or holding the special move button will cause Villager to flap his arms and gain height. After a few seconds (or by pressing the standard attack button), the balloons will dissociate from Villager, leaving him helpless. The balloons can also be popped; losing one impairs Villager's potential vertical height, and losing both leaves him  helpless . After using Balloon Trip, there is a period in which the helium has to recharge before it can be used effectively; if the helium is too low, then only one balloon will spawn."

However, the tree can be destroyed by other characters, and is a fairly slow move to use altogether - using the move once only advances through one of the four stages (plant, water, first chop, second chop), so completing the attack takes four total usages in the same location. The tree itself is extremely powerful, even as it grows. The axe can be swung during the chop stages regardless of distance from the tree, as long as that Villager's grown tree currently exists on the map. Has a chance of creating a woodchip or a rare chance of spawning a fruit once chopped down."

"1481","Wii Fit Trainer","Forward tilt","Dancer","11%","Assumes the Dancer pose to simultaneously perform a knifehand thrust in front and a scorpion kick in back. As a result, it is useful for punishing rolling opponents. It does not move the user at all on use, which can make it difficult to land. Both of Wii Fit Trainer's limbs have differing traits: the arm launches the opponent horizontally, whereas the leg launches them vertically. The arm KOs middleweights at 144% while near the edge, whereas the leg KOs them at 155%."
"1482","Wii Fit Trainer","Up tilt","","10%","Assumes the Triangle pose to attack with an outstretched arm. The hitbox covers Wii Fit Trainer's arm and body while stepping backward to assume triangle pose. The rising arm is intangible. The arm hitbox launches the opponent straight up and is reliable for combos, particularly into itself and up smash, or as a follow-up from a short hopped up aerial. The body hitbox sends the opponent away at a diagonal angle."
"1483","Wii Fit Trainer","Down tilt","Bridge","13.5%","Assumes the Bridge pose to attack with both knees. It has fairly quick start-up and deals both respectable damage and high hitstun, but lacks knockback for its power and has high ending lag. Useful for retaliating after dodging with a notable low crouch, hitting opponents on the ledge, or applying relatively safe shield pressure due to the pushback the move has."
"1484","Wii Fit Trainer","Dash attack","Gate","10% (early), 6% (late)","Assumes the Gate pose while sliding to attack with an arcing arm. It has a respectable duration, which makes it useful for mindgames when used alongside a fox-trot. However, it is punishable on shield."

Due to its hitbox placements, it can hit opponents in front of and/or behind, but can be awkward to connect with due to its small hitboxes.

"1504","Wii Fit Trainer","Side special","Header","15% (clean headbutt), 8.8%-12.3% (soccer ball)","Heads a soccer ball. It has impressive mindgame potential overall, due to its manipulable nature and hitboxes. The ball can be hit early if the special button is pressed, which launches the ball at different angles. Wii Fit Trainer can also air dodge upon initiating it, which drops the ball and allows Wii Fit Trainer to subsequently launching it with any other attack. However, air dodging while using Header renders helplessness. Aside from hitting the ball, the headbutt itself can be used as an attack and is able to meteor smash. In addition to its offensive potential, it has recovery potential: using it after a jump grants a slight boost upward, whereas using it while descending will briefly stall, similarly to Cape. However, it cannot be used again until Wii Fit Trainer either lands on a platform or stage or gets hit."
"1505","Wii Fit Trainer","Up special","Super Hoop","5% (hits 1-3)","Hula hoops twirl around Wii Fit Trainer’s body in order to ascend.

As it offers anti-rebounding priority, it can also beat out most weak attacks. As a result, it is an excellent point-blank interrupting tool. The first two hits can lock floored characters, although this is difficult to perform on most characters due to the move's height. The first two hits have very low ending lag, allowing either to jab cancel into Rising Uppercut; this acts as a KO combo at various percents, with hit 2 working past around 145%, and hit 1 working past 200%.

The first hit leads into the second hit, which deals excellent knockback that can KO Mario from the edge of Final Destination at 90%. Due to the first hit coming out at frame 4 and the second at frame 12, it's extremely fast while also being one of the strongest forward tilts in the game. It also has anti-rebounding priority and the longest range of his tilts due to Mac moving slightly forward during both hits,especially the first, making it useful out of a dash. As of patch 3.1.0, the second connects more reliably on opponents in the air, unlike in SSB4."
"1513","Little Mac","Up tilt","","6.5%","An overhead arcing backfist. Very fast, coming out on frame 4 and has low ending lag. It covers the entirety of Little Mac's body, which allows him to use it as a quick option to punish overhead attacks or rolls. It is Little Mac's best combo initiator in general due to its anti-rebounding priority, low knockback and speed. The back hit combos better due to Mac having less endlag after. Combos include itself at low percents, and Rising Uppercut or KO Uppercut at low/mid percents if the opponent is close to him. It can also lead into tilts or smash attacks depending on an opponent's reaction. However, it is unsafe at very low percents, as opponents can act before Little Mac can. It resembles Don Flamenco's Twirling Backhand used during Title Defense Mode in the Wii version of Punch-Out!!, albeit performed vertically instead of horizontally."
"1514","Little Mac","Down tilt","","8%","A crouching short straight-punch. Like his neutral attack and tilts, it has anti-rebounding priority and has extremely fast startup at frame 3. However, it has lost most its formidable combo potential from Smash 4 due to its higher ending lag and altered knockback angle, which sends opponents diagonally in front of Little Mac. As a result, it can only combo into tilts at 0%, and its only consistent combos at higher percents are Jolt Haymaker, forward aerial, dashing Rising Uppercut, dash attack forward air, or KO Uppercut. Otherwise, it is mainly used to force opponents into a landing situation for Mac to capitalize on. As of patch 3.1.0, down tilt's range now exceeds those of some swordfighters, now being on par with Mii Swordfighter's and longer than Ike's, so it has impressive range despite not being disjointed. It is one of Mac's main neutral tools due to its combo potential, speed, range, and relative safeness on shield compared to the rest of his attacks. It can also 2-frame which can lead into Jolt Haymaker or KO Uppercut to kill."
"1515","Little Mac","Dash attack","","10%","A lunging overhand. It is  fast for a dash attack (frame 7), travels a decent distance, and can be a situational KO option, having enough knockback to KO Mario at 136% from the edge of Final Destination. However, due of its lack of shieldstun, it is notoriously punishable on shield, and is easily punished with a grab and throw, which puts Little Mac at a severe disadvantage due to his abysmal air game. The first frame has an early hitbox that deals the same damage, but KOs much later. It can combo into itself at low percents."
"1516","Little Mac","Forward smash","Straight Smash","20%","Steps forward and throws one of three right-handed punch variations, depending on which angle the control stick is tilted. It's active on frame 14(15 if angled down) and has a moderate amount of ending lag with 26 frames of lag, making it surprisingly fast for its power. Little Mac also rushes forward during before the hitbox becomes active, giving it deceptively good range.
Up: An uppercut. It launches opponents vertically and has the largest hitbox out of all three punch variations, which makes it the easiest to connect while also being a decent anti-air. It deals powerful vertical knockback that KOs Mario at 102%, allowing it to finish off fighters with poor vertical endurance. It also grants super armor on frames 8-15. It resembles Little Mac's Star Punch and One-Star Punch in the NES and Wii versions of Punch-Out!!, respectively.
Forward: A cross. It has the highest knockback scaling out of all three punch variations, KOing Mario from center-stage at 89%. This makes it the most reliable out of the three in regard to KOing. It also grants super armor on frames 8-15. It is based on the cross Little Mac hits King Hippo with during the cutscene in which he defeats Hippo in the Wii version of Punch-Out!!
Down: A body hook. It deals the most damage out of all three punch variations, but its extremely low knockback scaling makes it unusable for KOing. Its high shieldstun makes it safer on shield than the other two punch variations, and it deals heavy shield damage, allowing it to deplete more than half a shield.

"1519","Little Mac","Up smash","","21% (clean), 16% (late)","A wide uppercut. Its first frame is highlighted by a spark, which acts as a sweetspot that possesses a flame effect and deals significant shield damage and is among the strongest up smashes in the game. Its sourspot also makes it useful for aerial protection and for KOing, thanks to its respectable damage output, high knockback scaling, and hitbox placement. Fast despite its power, since it comes out on frame 10. However, it has the highest amount of ending lag out of his grounded moves with 34 frames, making it punishable if not used carefully. Despite its appearance, it also only hits in front of Little Mac, but it has good vertical range, reaching high enough to challenge opponents standing on the bottom platforms of Battlefield, and low enough to reach some opponents on a ledge. It also grants super armor on frames 8-13."
"1520","Little Mac","Down smash","","13%","Spins 180° to throw a quick, downward angled right hook in each direction. It comes out on frame 10 and acts as a powerful semi-spike which hits on both sides. Coupled with its long range, it is one of Little Mac's only edgeguarding options. Like his other smash attacks, it grants super armor (frames 7-10 and 15-17). Unlike most down smashes, both of its hits have the same damage outputs."
"1521","Little Mac","Neutral aerial","Weak Jab","2%","A downward angled straight jab. Due to it hitting on frame 2 and having almost no ending lag, it is the fastest aerial of any kind in the game. It can be used as a combo breaker of sorts or spammed to combo when in the air. It also sends the opponent at the autolink angle, allowing Mac to combo on landing. It has a small hitbox on Mac's back. However, it has extremely low range, making it risky and difficult to use. The front hitbox has set knockback while the hitbox behind Mac has knockback."
"1522","Little Mac","Forward aerial","","5% (sweetspot), 4% (sourspot)","A hook. It comes out on frame 10 and has a low damage output, but hits at a semi-spike angle, allowing it to act as a gimp. It can combo out of several of Little Mac's moves, though this is offset by its meager damage. It can combo into Jolt Haymaker, being risky but very rewarding if used precisely: at mid percents leaves the opponent in an unfavorable position, and even KO early offstage. By itself, it can easily gimp poor recoveries past 100%. It can also lead into tech situations at around 100%."
"1523","Little Mac","Back aerial","","6% (sweetspot) 4% (sourspot)","A backfist. Like his forward aerial, it has a low damage output and hits at a semi-spike angle, but comes out one frame slower and deals 1% more damage. It can edge guard, but it has poor range and a short hitbox duration. It's also his strongest aerial, but is still too weak to KO."
"1524","Little Mac","Up aerial","","5% (sweetspot) 4% (sourspot)","An upward arcing hook. It is extremely fast for an up aerial (frame 5), though this is significantly offset by its short range, low hitbox duration, and noticeable ending lag. If used while near the ground, it can combo into up tilt, Rising Uppercut, or KO Uppercut at high percents. It's a great as an anti-air against opponents on platforms. It appears to be based on the jump Little Mac performs during his victory animation in the Wii version of Punch-Out!!"
"1525","Little Mac","Down aerial","","4% (spike/sourspot), 5% (sweetspot)","A downwards punch. The fist hitbox acts as a meteor smash. It autocancels in a short hop and is one of the quickest meteor smashes in the game due to coming out on frame 7 and having low ending lag, but is situational due to its extremely low knockback and damage, with its meteor smash being ineffective against anyone but fast-fallers unless Little Mac footstool jumps on the opponent immediately after. However, it can lock floored opponents, allowing Mac to finish them with any of his strongest attacks. It can also gimp, being good with opponents with poor recoveries, especially vertically. It will only get a meteor smash kill at 247% at the least."
"1526","Little Mac","Grab","","—","Clinches the opponent. In addition to having average range, Little Mac possesses moderate ending lag in his grabs. Unlike in SSB4, Mac's grab no longer has blindspots on his hand and arm. Its range can be increased by performing a roll cancel boost grab and it can even be used to cross-up opponents, although this is difficult to pull off."

"1528","Little Mac","Forward throw","","4% (hit), 4% (throw)","Rears his arm back and throws an overhand. Its low knockback scaling and slight endlag makes this move virtually impossible to lead into any combos: outside of dealing damage or set up tech-chases at low-to mid percents, it does not have much utility. Nearby opponents will be launched at a near-perfect vertical trajectory."
"1529","Little Mac","Back throw","","4% (hit), 5% (throw)","Spins the opponent around and throws an uppercut. The most damaging out of all of Little Mac's throws, as well as the highest knockback scaling. This is his only throw with any KO potential, although it is not the strongest KOing option as it KOs Mario starting at 140% from the very edge of Final Destination. Nearby opponents will be launched at a near-perfect vertical trajectory."
"1530","Little Mac","Up throw","","4% (hit), 3% (throw)","An uppercut. Nearby opponents will be launched at a near-perfect vertical trajectory.

It is chargeable, grants 8% (9.6% on 1v1) heavy armor while charging, can be reversed upon release, and moves Little Mac at a good distance forward, which increases with charge. The charge can be cancelled by pressing the shield button. When fully charged, it deals consistent 30% damage throughout the move, lacking a weaker late hit and launching the opponent away with extreme knockback. Due to the heavy armor, it can be useful to prevent the opponent from starting a combo with a tilt or extending the combo with an aerial attack, giving Mac a way to escape from combos. However it depends on the move and sometimes the character, as it's not useful against hits that deal more than 8%.
If the Power Meter is fully charged, it becomes the KO Uppercut, a fast and extremely powerful leaping uppercut, with the ability to pierce shields and also has enough range to reach through the bottom platform of Battlefield. Despite the name, however, it is not a true one-hit KO, but instead KOs at low to mid percentages (KO's the lightest character starting at 12%, and the heaviest starting at 36%), while also granting super armor on frames 8-9. However, KO Uppercut possesses a considerable amount of ending lag, making it punishable regardless if it hits or not, and the Uppercut is immediately lost if Little Mac holds it for 4 seconds and is then hit by any move that causes tumbling. A midair KO Uppercut, although weaker and blockable/counterable, can also be used as a recovery option, and despite the much weaker power, it is still strong enough to KO, especially when high enough."

It can be used almost instantly by pressing the special button immediately after first pressing it. Grants brief intangibility on the ground during startup, and its long hitbox duration allows it to punish moves effectively. It deals high damage and good knockback, making it a great combo finisher and reliable KO move at the ledge, even in the air. It does not render him helpless if used in midair, making it a good horizontal recovery option. However, it can only be used once before landing, thus the player must use it carefully due to Little Mac's mediocre recovery. Jolt Haymaker was given more range as of patch 3.1.0, allowing the grounded version to hit opponents on the bottom platforms of Battlefield.
An advanced version of the move can be performed dubbed the ""Superman Haymaker"". Performing this requires a dash jump to be inputted from a standing position, then Jolt Haymaker to be used immediately before Little Mac leaves the ground (similar to the input of a short hop aerial). If done correctly, the resulting Jolt Haymaker is granted increased vertical height and horizontal distance, giving Mac the ability to soar over projectiles and better pressure opponents on platforms."
"1538","Little Mac","Up special","Rising Uppercut","3% (hit 1), 1% (hits 2 - 5), 3% (hit 6)","A right-handed, jumping corkscrew uppercut, followed immediately by a left-handed uppercut. The first uppercut hits multiple times, whereas the second uppercut hits once and has extremely high knockback. Thanks to Little Mac's excellent traction, it is a very potent out of shield option, and is also one of his only reliable aerial finishers aside from Jolt Haymaker. It also grants 3 frames of intangibility on start-up, while the grounded version covers a decent amount of vertical distance. Conversely, the aerial version is less effective at covering vertical distance and granting maneuverability compared to the grounded version, which make it very ineffective for recovery. It appears to be based on Little Mac's Three-Star Punch in the Wii version of Punch-Out!!"
"1539","Little Mac","Down special","Slip Counter","1.3× (minimum 10%)","Assumes a full crouch stance and, if hit, immediately counterattacks by slipping inside to throw an uppercut. It shoots Little Mac forward during the counterattack, allowing it to hit distant opponents and act as a recovery extended offstage, albeit with high risk. Due to the counter window being active on frame 5, it has one of the fastest startups of any counter, making it an effective defensive option. However, the mechanics of the uppercut's delivery, such as the short delay and Mac's own movement, can also make it infrequently whiff. It appears to be based on Glass Joe's Delayed Right Hook used during Title Defense Mode in the Wii version of Punch-Out!!"
"1540","Little Mac","Final Smash","Giga Mac Rush","3% (beginning), 2% (beginning, late), 59% (entire)","Little Mac transforms into his Giga Mac form and rushes forward, attacking any caught opponents with an uppercut. He then proceeds to unleash a rush of punches that concludes with an uppercut. For a Final Smash, it deals a massive amount of damage, and the initial dash can be used as a niche recovery option."
"1541","Shulk","Neutral attack","","2%","A jab, followed by a full roundhouse kick then an upward slash. It now connects consistently compared to the version in Smash 4, and the first two hits can now jab reset, though its slim hitbox makes this difficult on most prone characters. It also has very low range compared to his other moves, but is very fast in comparison (frame 5). Its second hit loosely resembles Dive Sobat, one of Reyn's Physical Arts, albeit being an inward kick instead of outwards."
"1542","Shulk","Neutral attack","","1.5%","A jab, followed by a full roundhouse kick then an upward slash. It now connects consistently compared to the version in Smash 4, and the first two hits can now jab reset, though its slim hitbox makes this difficult on most prone characters. It also has very low range compared to his other moves, but is very fast in comparison (frame 5). Its second hit loosely resembles Dive Sobat, one of Reyn's Physical Arts, albeit being an inward kick instead of outwards."
"1543","Shulk","Neutral attack","","5% (clean), 4.1% (late)","A jab, followed by a full roundhouse kick then an upward slash. It now connects consistently compared to the version in Smash 4, and the first two hits can now jab reset, though its slim hitbox makes this difficult on most prone characters. It also has very low range compared to his other moves, but is very fast in comparison (frame 5). Its second hit loosely resembles Dive Sobat, one of Reyn's Physical Arts, albeit being an inward kick instead of outwards."
"1544","Shulk","Forward tilt","","13.5% (blade), 12% (beam)","An inward slash. Its impressive damage output and high knockback growth make it powerful for a tilt attack. While near the edge of Final Destination, its blade hitbox KOs at roughly 97%. It also deals high shield damage when Buster is active. However, its range is shorter than Shulk's other moves, while its narrow hitbox allows smaller characters to crouch under it. It is based on one of Shulk's basic Auto Attacks."
"1545","Shulk","Up tilt","","10% (blade), 9% (beam)","An overhead arcing slash. It wide hitbox and sheer range make it a useful move overall, since it can almost reach the top platform of Battlefield and function as an anti-air attack, limit edge get-up options, pressure shields, or trap landings. With Buster active, it is a useful damage racking option from under platforms. Without Arts, it can also function as a situational KOing option thanks to its high knockback growth: it can KO grounded opponents at 160% without rage, and functions as one of Shulk's strongest KO moves with the Smash Art, KOing within the 105% range. However, it only hits in front of Shulk at its beginning, and has moderate start-up and ending lag."
"1546","Shulk","Down tilt","","9.5% (blade), 7.5% (beam)","A kneeling inward slash. Moderately slow for a tilt attack, but it has good range and the lowest amount of ending lag out of his entire moveset. As a result, it is a good combo starter while Jump, Speed, or Buster are active. Unlike the version in Smash 4, the hitbox now covers the end of the beam blade. When spaced correctly, it is also able to hit edge-hanging opponents once their invincibility ends."
"1547","Shulk","Dash attack","","11% (beam),12.5% (blade)","A braking inward slash. Somewhat short ranged but can connect easily. When it is coupled with its decent damage output, it can function as a situational KOing option. While near the edge of Final Destination, it KOs middleweights at around 160%. However, it has high ending lag (28 frames)."
"1548","Shulk","Forward smash","","5.5% (hit 1), 13% (hit 2 blade), 11.5% (hit 2 beam)","A thrust, which causes the Monado to reveal its beam blade. It consists of two hits: the first is from the Monado's blade, which leads into the second hit from its beam blade. It is the fourth longest ranged non-projectile forward smash in the game, surpassed only by Simon/Richter, Corrin, and the Mii Gunner. When coupled with its ability to be angled, it can hit opponents attempting to grab the edge. The Buster Art grants the move good shield-pressuring potential, as it can deplete half a shield. While near the edge of Final Destination, the non-angled blade/beam KOs at 74%/86%. However, the first hit's low priority makes it easily canceled by weak attacks, while the move's high ending lag (44 frames) makes it completely unsafe on shield. As a result, it is best used as a punishment option, or a high-risk high-reward mixup against approaching opponents. It is based on Slit Edge, one of Shulk's Physical Arts."
"1549","Shulk","Up smash","","4.5% (hit 1), 13.5% (hit 2)","Squats and slams the Monado's hilt onto the ground, causing its beam blade to thrust upward. An overall effective move for punishing, as the first hit's deceptive horizontal range launches opponents into the second hit. This allows it to punish rolls, landings, and edge get-up options. The second hit's vertical range, high knockback and transcendent priority allow it to KO reliably. Unlike forward smash, it does not possess a sweetspot and sourspot, which also gives it consistent KO potential at around 109%. The move has considerable start-up (hits on frame 18) and ending lag (37 frames), making it punishable."
"1550","Shulk","Down smash","","Hit 1:14% (blade), 11% (beam) Hit 2: 12% (blade), 10% (beam) Hit 3: 10% (blade), 8% (beam) Hit 4: 8% (blade), 6% (beam) Hit 5: 6% (blade), 4% (beam)","A crouching spinning slash with the Monado, with Shulk spinning in a full circle thrice. It is capable of hitting during any of its five hitboxes (three at Shulk's front and two at his back), with its first hit being strong enough to KO reliably near the edge at 78%/85% (blade/beam). Each spin quickly loses power, but the final spin has slightly more range. The Smash Art grants the later hits KO potential, despite their weak power without any Monado Arts. It is usually impossible to connect more than one hit together unless Buster is active, in which case it will break full shields if an opponent is cornered at an edge and the first three hits land. Extremely useful for punishing rolls and sidesteps thanks to its multiple hitboxes and range, but suffers from the most overall lag out of Shulk's smash attacks because of its considerable start-up (hits on frame 18) and ending lag (41 frames). It resembles War Swing, one of Reyn's Physical Arts."
"1551","Shulk","Neutral aerial","","8.5% (blade), 7.5% (beam)","A circular slash around himself. It is one of Shulk's most useful approach options, thanks to its wide range, full 360 degree coverage, low landing lag (6 frames) and long duration. Unlike the Smash 4 version, the hitboxes now match the trail until the end where the Monado retracts its beam blade. Its hitbox begins slightly behind Shulk's toes and continues all the way over his head, allowing the initial frames to start combos if an opponent misses a tech, the later frames being able to punish air dodges, and the final frames having approach-deterring utility. Overall, it is one of Shulk's defining moves, as it can start combos while Jump, Speed or Buster are active, which can lead into a grab, neutral attack, forward tilt, up tilt, aerials or Air Slash. It can also neutralize weak projectiles, such as those from Toon Link or Diddy Kong. However, its long-lasting hitbox and very high ending lag (46 frames) make it a very unsafe move to use off-stage when fast falling, as Shulk will be in serious danger of self-destructing."
"1552","Shulk","Forward aerial","","8% (blade), 6.5% (beam)","A downward slash. It has the lowest amount of ending lag out of his aerials (24 frames) and low landing lag (10 frames), while its range grants it excellent coverage for an aerial, which makes it great for interrupting approaches and spacing. It is also a dependable combo option with either Speed or Buster active, and a powerful edge-guarding move, as it can easily cover their options (in Jump) or KO them outright while offstage at percents as low as 50% (with Smash). In Jump/Speed/Buster, it can allow Shulk to perform a wall of pain ending with Air Slash; this is a damage/KO combo at certain percentages, which has been dubbed the ""Fair Slash"" combo by players."
"1553","Shulk","Back aerial","Behind Thrust","12.5% (blade), 8.5% (beam)","A delayed reverse gripped thrust. The Monado's blade deals respectable damage with high knockback growth, making it a powerful KO move; it KOs at the edge at roughly 94%/137% (blade/beam) without Arts, and 65%/85% in Smash. It has lost its initial blade hitbox near Shulk's body from Smash 4, but is no longer as punishable due to its reduced landing lag (11 frames). Hence, it is a useful spacing tool due to its high horizontal range, but only if spaced spaced correctly or alongside Jump/Speed's aerial drift. However, it has slow start-up (19 frames) and a narrow, brief hitbox, making it very difficult to time; a few consistent methods are to perform it at the peak of short hop before fast falling without Arts, or immediately out of a short hop in the Speed Art."
"1554","Shulk","Up aerial","","5.5% (hit 1), 10.5% (hit 2 blade), 8% (hit 2 beam)","An upward thrust, which causes the Monado to reveal its beam blade. Like his forward and up smashes, the first hit from the Monado's blade leads into the second hit from its beam blade. It has tremendous vertical range that is capable of reaching through the main platform of Town and City; however, it has very minimal horizontal range and each hit only lasts 2 frames, which can make it difficult to connect with, especially if Shulk has too much momentum. It is one of the most damaging up aerials in the game if both hits connect (sweetspot only); coupled with its second hit's high knockback growth, it is a fearsome (albeit difficult to land) KO option near the upper blast line. It also has the second lowest landing lag out of Shulk's aerials (9 frames), giving it some spammability if under a platform. If the second hit of an up aerial lands, Shulk can land, switch into another Art, and combo into another up aerial; this is a KO confirm known as the ""Monado Cyclone"" that can work at a wide percent range with the right Arts active, though it is quite difficult to set up."
"1555","Shulk","Down aerial","","7.5% (hit 1 blade), 6% (hit 1 beam), 11.5% (hit 2 blade), 10.5% (hit 2 beam)","A downward thrust, which causes the Monado to reveal its beam blade. Like his forward and up smashes, the first hit from the Monado's blade leads into the second hit from its beam blade. The second hit meteor smashes if the blade hitbox connects. Like his up aerial, it has minimal horizontal range, each hit only lasts 2 frames, and its first hit might not connect into its second hit if Shulk is moving too fast. However, it has excellent range and high knockback, making it a decent edge-guarding option, as it can stage spike edge-hanging opponents, reach distant offstage opponents, or even KO outright at the edge starting from 108%. The first hit can also drag opponents offstage for a meteor smash if they are standing right next to a ledge. It has high landing lag (14 frames), making it punishable if missed."
"1556","Shulk","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his left arm."
"1557","Shulk","Pummel","","1.2%","Hits the opponent with the Monado's pommel. It is moderately fast and has middling damage for a pummel, but it becomes the strongest pummel in the game (in terms of damage-per-hit) with Buster active, as it will deal 1.8%."
"1558","Shulk","Forward throw","","3% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","An upward swipe. It lacks true follow-ups because of its base knockback, but it can lead into a dash attack or a forward aerial at low percentages with Speed or Buster active. With the Smash Art active, it is a powerful KOing option, doing so at about 110% at the edge of Final Destination. It is also capable of locking nearby floored opponents, a trait shared with all of Shulk's throws."
"1559","Shulk","Back throw","","3% (hit 1), 6% (throw)","Pulls the opponent behind himself and performs a reversed gripped thrust. Shulk's most damaging throw and causes the opponent to suffer back-facing knockback, which allows it to be used as a set-up for a Back Slash. With Smash active, it is one of the strongest back throws in the game, as it KOs around 90%, surpassing Ness's back throw."
"1560","Shulk","Up throw","","3% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Heaves the opponent in the air and performs a kneeling upward thrust. It is mostly used for aerial mixups since it cannot true combo into most attacks: at low percentages and/or with Buster active, it can lead into up tilt or Air Slash, or a ground attack if the opponent air dodges. With Jump active, it can lead into a neutral aerial or forward aerial, the latter of which requires the opponent to DI away. At high percentages, it can act as a set-up into the ""Monado Purge"" combo, which is an up throw to up aerial, though this is extremely situational since opponents can air dodge out of it in any direction."
"1561","Shulk","Down throw","","3% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Pins the opponent to the ground and thrusts the Monado into them via a jumping stab. With no Arts active or any Art active aside from Buster, it lacks combo or KO potential because of its throw hitbox's base knockback and very low damage output. However, it is an excellent combo throw with Buster active, as it can follow up with down tilt or forward tilt at low to mid percents, forward smash, forward aerial or Air Slash at mid percents, and even start a KO combo into Air Slash or other attacks if Buster is buffer-canceled during the throw's animation."
"1562","Shulk","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Slashes around himself while getting up."

"1566","Shulk","Neutral special","Monado Arts","Jump: 6s duration, 18s cooldown Speed: 8s duration, 16s cooldown Shield: 6s duration, 16s cooldown Buster: 10s duration, 14s cooldown Smash: 8s duration, 16s cooldown","Activates one of five Monado-based Arts: Jump, Speed, Shield, Buster, or Smash. Each Art significantly enhances particular attributes at the cost of significantly hindering others, and all last for varying durations unless manually canceled. A wheel can be used by holding the Special button, selecting an Art, and then releasing the Special button, which instantly activates an Art even while in hitstun; alternatively, the special button can be pressed once to cycle through each Art manually, and pressed thrice to cancel a current Art. Each Art has varied cooldown times and durations. Shulk poses and announces an Art's name if it activates when he is not attacking or dodging; this grants 14 frames of intangibility and can be used to replace landing lag animations or change directions in midair. This is pivotal for several Monado Art-based advanced techniques, including the Monado Art Landing Lag Cancel and Dial Storage."
"1567","Shulk","Side special","Back Slash","10% (blade), 9% (beam), 16% (back hit blade), 14% (back hit beam)","A leaping downward slash, with Shulk occasionally yelling “Back Slash!” during the move. The Monado's blade beam glows red during the move, referencing Physical Arts in his home game. Shulk takes a small leap forward upon start-up, giving it slightly more range and allows him to jump over small projectiles. The distance of the leap can be adjusted by holding left or right during the leap. True to its name, it deals more damage and has higher knockback if it hits the opponent's back: the blade/beam hitbox will KO at around 74%/88% at the edge. Conversely, the front hitbox is incapable of KOing till excessively high percents, unless in the Smash Art. It has recovery potential since it snaps to the ledge if started at a height slightly higher than the top platform of Battlefield, though it is risky since the move cannot be canceled."
"1568","Shulk","Up special","Air Slash","6% (hit 1 blade), 5% (hit 1 beam), 5.5% (hit 2)","A jumping upward slash, similar to Dolphin Slash, with Shulk occasionally yelling “Air Slash!”. The Monado's blade beam glows pink during the move, referencing Break Arts in his home game. It is a natural combo: its first hit has set knockback, while pressing the attack button again will result in a second hit, which is an outward slash that grants a small vertical boost, especially if used late. Its second hit has extremely high knockback growth, which makes it a useful KOing option, especially from out of shield; its second hit KOs approximately at 106% near an edge. The Jump Art increases vertical distance gained by the first slash. However, the Jump Art can cause the natural combo to whiff due to the additional vertical distance. The first slash will automatically snap to ledges during its ending frames."
"1569","Shulk","Down special","Vision","10% (normal minimum), 13% (forward-held minimum)","A counterattack involving Shulk using the Monado to foresee an attack. If he is hit, Shulk retaliates with a slow, powerful, and long-ranged slash that launches opponents forward. Alternatively, holding forward while counterattacking on the ground causes a fast dashing slash that deals more damage and knockback growth in addition to launching opponents backward, but its speed and Shulk's momentum can cause it to occasionally miss its target. Previously one of the strongest counters in Smash 4, its knockback scaling has since been lowered and it has lost its unblockable properties, lowering its notorious power. Despite this, it now has no sweetspot or sourspot, making its damage consistent, and Monado Arts can affect the KO potential of the counterattack. As a downside, Vision loses counter frames if repeatedly used over a short period of time, making it and Witch Time the only counterattacks that lose effectiveness if spammed. Counter frames are regained over time or once Shulk is KO'd. The counterattack resembles Stream Edge, one of Shulk's Physical Arts."
"1570","Shulk","Final Smash","Chain Attack","3% (hit 1), 2% (hits 2-12), 12% (hit 13), 5% (hit 14)","Traps opponents in a bright ball of light. If it hits, Shulk summons Dunban, Riki, and Fiora to perform a Chain Attack on the opponent, which he then concludes with a powerful slash. Chain Attack's damage output and knockback are also affected by Monado Arts. However, it has a short range, as Shulk needs to be close to the opponent in order for its first hit to land. In addition, Arts can expire during the Chain Attack's cutscene, which affects its damage output and knockback."
"1571","Duck Hunt","Neutral attack","","1.5%","The dog performs a paw swipe, followed by a headbutt, followed by a double-footed side kick performed from the baby freeze (a variation of the freeze breakdancing move).

"1579","Duck Hunt","Forward smash","Zapper","4% (hits 1 and 2), 9% (hit 3)","The dog and duck look forward before the NES Zapper fires three shots in front of them while they comically dodge the shots. It is a semi-spike and the longer it is charged, the larger its range becomes. However, its first two hits are unreliable, as their angles and very high knockback growth can occasionally launch opponents too early, and thus allow them to evade its last hit.  This move can be angled."
"1580","Duck Hunt","Up smash","","2.5% (hits 1 and 2), 10% (hit 3)","The dog and duck look upward before the NES Zapper fires three shots upward while they comically dodge the shots.

Its first and last hits are in front of the dog, while the second hit is behind him. Its last hit launches the opponent behind the dog, and as a result, Duck Hunt must face away from the edge when attempting to use this move in order to properly launch the opponent off-stage. Like forward and up smashes, its range increases the longer it is charged, but its first two hits are unreliable because of their angles and very high knockback growth."

The can is explosive and subsequent neutral special button presses alert the player with the Zapper to shoot the can forward. After 9 button presses, the can starts to emit smoke and will then explode. The can is also capable of being manipulated by the dog and duck's attacks, with its tilt attacks being especially useful in this regard. However, this also applies to the opponent's attacks. The explosion can also damage Duck Hunt. Overall, it is Duck Hunt's most versatile projectile, and their most useful edge-guarding option. Although its explosion has very high knockback growth, it lacks KO potential out of edge-guarding because of its average damage output and low base knockback."

It has two flight trajectories: a slow, higher arc and a faster, straight arc. Moving while performing the move initiates the former, whereas standing still and performing the move initiates the latter. Pressing the special button again causes the off-screen hunter to destroy it with 5 quick shots from the NES Zapper, making it a natural combo. It is useful for hindering approaches, but can also act as a set-up into a dash attack from 0% to medium percentages, or into a forward aerial at high percentages. Although somewhat situational, the clay pigeon can also act as a makeshift landmine by allowing it to land on the ground, and then destroying it to surprise an opponent. Alternatively, Duck Hunt can attack the pigeon, causing it to explode into fragments that will damage nearby opponents. However, opponents can attack the pigeon as well, which will damage Duck Hunt."

"1603","Snake","Neutral attack","","2.5%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Holding the attack button without hitting an enemy will have Snake repeatedly perform the first hit."
"1604","Snake","Neutral attack","","6%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Holding the attack button without hitting an enemy will have Snake repeatedly perform the first hit."
"1605","Snake","Forward tilt","","4% (hit 1), 9% (hit 2, body), 10% (hit 2, arm), 11% (hit 2, fists)","A forward knee-thrust. Pressing the attack button a second time will have Snake follow up with an overhead swing with both arms. The knee slightly launches opponents vertically, making it harder to connect the second hit at higher percents. This move is seen during a cutscene in Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes when Snake fights Gray Fox."
"1606","Snake","Up tilt","","14.5% (clean), 13.5% (late)","An upward scorpion kick. One of Snake's best KO options due to its fast startup, decent range, and high knockback. Depending on the opponent's damage, this makes a great follow up from down throw. Can also be used as an out-of-shield option."
"1607","Snake","Down tilt","","12%","A low spin kick while prone. Deals decent damage for its speed."
"1608","Snake","Dash attack","","11% (clean), 8% (late)","Does a somersault forward. Moves Snake forward quite a bit. Has a reasonable level of knockback, but not enough to make it a reliable KO move. The somersault and subsequent transition to crouching are visually identical to those moves used by Snake in the Metal Gear Solid series."
"1609","Snake","Forward smash","","22%","Snake takes out an RPG-7 rocket launcher and aims it at the ground directly in front of himself, causing a huge explosion. It has very slow startup (frame 41), but it is one of the strongest smash attacks in the game, being able to KO exceptionally early. Interestingly, it can be absorbed by moves like PSI Magnet and Oil Panic, making it one of the few non-projectile moves to have this property."
"1610","Snake","Up smash","","4% (mortar), 14% (shell)","Snake slams a mortar in front of himself and fires a shell into the air. The slamming down of the mortar knocks the enemy directly into the path of the shell. The movement of the shell is almost entirely vertical, landing directly in front of Snake's position. Charging the up smash does not increase its power, but it increases the speed and height of which it travels. When fully charged, the projectile greatly exceeds the range of Palutena's up smash. The fixed trajectory of the shell, coupled with the fact that charging it doesn't affect the damage, makes this move great for edgeguarding."
"1611","Snake","Down smash","","12% (hit 1), 14% (hit 2)","A double-sided kick. Launches opponents at horizontal angles with considerable knockback. One of Snake's fastest ground moves."
"1612","Snake","Neutral aerial","","3% (hit 1 - 3), 12% (hit 4)","Snake performs four kicks in quick succession. At low percents against heavy and fast-falling characters, a short-hopped neutral aerial can lead to a neutral attack, tilts, and a short-hop down aerial."
"1613","Snake","Forward aerial","","15% (foot), 14% (leg)","A midair axe kick. Has slow start-up and high ending lag, but it is a very powerful meteor smash with great vertical and horizontal reach. Connection with the leg results in very powerful vertical knockback."
"1614","Snake","Back aerial","","16% (clean, feet), 14% (clean, legs), 10% (late, feet), 9% (late, legs)","Snake dropkicks behind himself, planking in the air. Has fairly fast start-up along with good reach and very high horizontal knockback when sweetspotted. While it has high ending lag like his other aerials, Snake's back aerial never auto-cancels, unlike his other aerials, so it is very punishable if it misses. Has sex kick properties."
"1615","Snake","Up aerial","","14% (clean), 10% (late)","Snake dropkicks straight upwards, similar to his back aerial. Has fairly fast start-up with good vertical reach and powerful vertical knockback, but has considerable ending lag, like the rest of Snake's aerials."
"1616","Snake","Down aerial","","4% (hit 1), 3% (hits 2 and 3), 10% (hit 4)","Snake launches four subsequent stomps below himself. A powerful damage-racking out-of-shield option. The third and fourth kicks add vertical speed, allowing Snake to slow his fall and autocancel the move from a shorthop. Oddly, shortly after the first kick Snake is pushed downwards slightly."
"1617","Snake","Grab","","—","Reaches in front of himself with both of his arms, grabbing and holding his opponent in a restraining chokehold. The grabbing position itself is unique to Snake. Based on a similar maneuver from the Metal Gear Solid games."
"1618","Snake","Pummel","","1.2%","Tightens his chokehold."
"1619","Snake","Forward throw","","9%","Snake twists the opponent's arms behind their back, steps his leg forward, and then forcefully shoves them into the ground in front of him."
"1620","Snake","Back throw","","9%","Snake performs a sasae tsurikomi ashi[2], shifting the restrained opponent towards him, trips them with a sweep of his leg, and flips them over, slamming them on the ground behind him. Resembles his primary throw from Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2."
"1621","Snake","Up throw","","7% (slam), 4% (throw)","Snake suplexes his opponent, slamming them back-first. Can combo into his up tilt at low percents."
"1622","Snake","Down throw","Silent Takedown","9%","Lays the opponent on the floor, putting the opponent into a downed status. How soon an opponent can act depends on their damage. At high percents, gives Snake guaranteed follow-up options, including his up tilt. Resembles a similar CQC maneuver from the Metal Gear Solid series, in which Snake rendered enemies unconscious by suffocating them."
"1623","Snake","Floor attack (front)","","7%","While getting up, kicks on one side and punches on the other."
"1624","Snake","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Rotates his body around with both his feet sticking out and gets up."
"1625","Snake","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Gets up and kicks both sides of himself."
"1626","Snake","Edge attack","","10%","Climbs on to the stage and performs a sweep kick."
"1627","Snake","Neutral special","Hand Grenade","0.9~4.25% (grenade), 8.6~10.75% (explosion)","Snake pulls out a grenade and unpins it. The grenade will detonate after 2.5 seconds. Tapping the B button will have Snake throw the grenade right away, while holding down the B button will have Snake to continue to hold on to the grenade until B is released. The distance Snake throws the grenade can be controlled by holding forwards or backwards on the stick when the grenade is thrown. Pressing the shield button or taking damage will cause Snake to drop the grenade. Dropped grenades can be picked up and thrown like ordinary items. Snake can have up to two grenades active at a time. Aesthetically, if Snake is standing too close to a grenade when it detonates, he will duck and cover his ears. Kirby mimics this behavior when he uses Grenade as a Copy Ability."
"1628","Snake","Side special","Remote Missile","7% (early/dropped missile), 14% (missile)","Snake takes out a Nikita missile launcher and fires a remote-controlled missile. The missile can be controlled with the control stick. Pressing the shield button will cause Snake to put the launcher away and stop controlling the missile. One of his best moves for edgeguarding, as it allows him to put pressure on an offstage opponent without putting himself at risk of an attack."
"1629","Snake","Up special","Cypher","6% (camera)","Grabs onto a flying reconnaissance camera and slowly hovers upwards. Snake gains slight armor while hanging on the camera. Does not put Snake into a helpless state, meaning he can continue to perform attacks once the move ends. However, he cannot use Cypher again until he lands on the ground, grabs onto a ledge, or takes knockback. One can cancel the move early by performing any aerial attack, pressing down on the stick, or airdodging. When the move ends, the Cypher will continue to fly upwards and damage enemies it comes into contact with. Activating Cypher will not cancel Snake's existing momentum, so if Snake is falling downwards, the Cypher will have to slowly decelerate him before starting to move him upwards."
"1630","Snake","Down special","C4","17% (explosion)","Snake bends down and plants a C4 on the ground where he is standing. When used in the air, he instead drops the C4 straight down. Snake can also stick the C4 towards a wall if he is standing near one, or attach it directly onto a nearby enemy. By using the move when a C4 has already been placed, Snake takes out a remote detonator and detonates the explosive. The C4 is one of Snake's most versatile tools; it can be used for KOs, stage control, mindgames, edgeguarding, and more. Snake can also use the C4 for recovery by dropping it in midair and detonating it, blasting him upwards and allowing him to use Cypher again without touching the ground or a ledge."
"1631","Snake","Final Smash","Covering Fire","15% (per missile)","Snake will toss a flare grenade, exclaim ""It's showtime!"", crouch, and put his hand up to his ear, which will cause a crosshair to appear onscreen. At the upper left are two bars: one solid, and one made up of 5 segments. The solid bar indicates how much time until the missiles are launched, while the segmented bar underneath represents the missiles: missiles that have locked onto an opponent are shown as red segments, while those that have not are shown as grayed-out segments.
The crosshair can be guided to lock on to opponents, marking them with a reticle. Opponents can even be marked with multiple missiles. After the brief duration, the missiles will launch from the foreground, attacking the targeted opponents. The missiles that have not locked on to a target will instead fire at around where the crosshair was last positioned."
"1632","Sonic","Neutral attack","","2%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Sonic the Fighters. Its first and second hit are capable of jab locking. Holding the attack button will have Sonic perform the first hit repeatedly."
"1633","Sonic","Neutral attack","","1.5%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Sonic the Fighters. Its first and second hit are capable of jab locking. Holding the attack button will have Sonic perform the first hit repeatedly."
"1634","Sonic","Neutral attack","","4%","The Punch + Punch + Kick combo from Sonic the Fighters. Its first and second hit are capable of jab locking. Holding the attack button will have Sonic perform the first hit repeatedly."
"1635","Sonic","Forward tilt","","4% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2 feet), 5% (hit 2 legs)","The Horse Kick from Sonic the Fighters. It hits twice, has minimal start-up lag, and can be angled. Altogether, these traits make it useful for spacing, starting tech-chases, or as an out of shield option."
"1636","Sonic","Up tilt","","2% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","A 540 kick, similar to Captain Falcon's up smash. Its decent vertical range makes it a fairly useful anti-air attack, although it has poor horizontal range. It resembles the Skip Kick from Sonic the Fighters."
"1637","Sonic","Down tilt","","6%","A legsweep. Its diagonal angle can lead to combos at lower percents. It resembles the Leg Throw from Sonic the Fighters."
"1638","Sonic","Dash attack","","6% (clean), 4% (late)","A flying kick similar to Fox's. It is a reliable follow-up from a down throw. While its very minimal start-up lag can allow it to pressure unwary opponents, it is very punishable because of its considerable ending lag."
"1639","Sonic","Forward smash","","14%","The Wind-Up Punch from Sonic the Fighters. It has high knockback growth, deceptive range, and can be angled, all of which make it one of Sonic's most viable KOing options. However, its very low base knockback makes it better suited for KO attempts later instead of earlier. It also has noticeable start-up and ending lag, making it risky if used unwisely."
"1640","Sonic","Up smash","","5% (hit 1), 1% (hits 2-7), 3% (hit 8)","A jumping Spin Dash. It hits multiple times, with its last hit having extremely high knockback growth. However, its last hit has average base knockback, which makes it better suited for KO attempts later instead of earlier."
"1641","Sonic","Down smash","","12%","A split kick, similar to Fox and Falco's down smashes. It has the lowest amount of start-up lag out of Sonic's smash attacks and hits on both sides, which make it useful for punishing rolls. It is also a semi-spike, which makes it very useful for edge-guarding. However, it lasts for only 1 frame, and has considerable ending lag."
"1642","Sonic","Neutral aerial","","12% (clean), 8% (late), 5% (latest)","Curls up into a ball and spins while slightly undulating up and down. In addition to being a reliable follow-up from Spin Dash, Spin Charge, and Spring Jump-assisted combos, its launching angle makes its clean and late hitboxes into useful combo starters at low to medium percentages when SHFF'd. It resembles the Air Spin from Sonic the Fighters and the Insta-Shield, an attack that debuted in Sonic the Hedgehog 3."
"1643","Sonic","Forward aerial","","0.8% (hits 1-5), 3% (hit 6)","A corkscrew battering ram, similar to Pikachu's forward aerial. It is tied with up aerial for the lowest amount of start-up lag out of Sonic's aerials. When coupled with its last hit's very high knockback growth, it is useful for spacing and edge-guarding. It can also combo into itself in certain instances, thanks to Sonic's fast air speed and its fairly large auto-canceling window. It resembles the Emerald Dive from Sonic the Fighters."
"1644","Sonic","Back aerial","","14% (clean), 10% (late)","A hook kick. Its clean hitbox's impressive damage output and high knockback growth make it one of Sonic's most viable KOing options, especially when used for edge-guarding. However, it has moderate start-up."
"1645","Sonic","Up aerial","","3% (hit 1), 8% (hit 2)","A scissor kick. Its very large auto-cancel window makes it deceptively safe and easy to avoid even its fairly low landing lag. In addition to being a reliable follow-up from Spin Dash, Spin Charge, and Spring Jump-assisted combos, it is a viable KOing option near the upper blast line, especially as a follow-up from Spring Jump. Both hits don't always connect very reliably however."
"1646","Sonic","Down aerial","Shooting Star Kick","8% (clean), 7%/5% (late)","A diagonal flying kick. It is a stall-then-fall, but unlike the majority of other stall-then-falls, it is relatively safe to use off-stage thanks to it having noticeably less ending lag in comparison. Its clean hit also meteor smashes aerial opponents at the beginning of the attack, but not grounded opponents. It resembles the Stomp Dive from Sonic the Fighters and the Sonic Rocket from Sonic Battle."
"1647","Sonic","Grab","","—","Clinches the opponent."
"1648","Sonic","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike. A fairly fast pummel."
"1649","Sonic","Forward throw","","1% (hit 1), 6% (throw)","A stretch kick. Due to its average damage output, very high base knockback, and average knockback growth, it is mainly used to force the opponent off-stage. It also has KO potential, albeit only on edges and at very high percents. It resembles the Top Kick from Sonic Battle."
"1650","Sonic","Back throw","","7%","Quickly backflips repeatedly with the opponent in tow before performing the tomoe nage[1] (a Judo throw). It is Sonic's only throw with consistent KO potential."
"1651","Sonic","Up throw","","1% (hit 1), 5% (throw)","Heaves the opponent upward and sharpens his quills to stab them. It can be followed up with a neutral aerial, up aerial and inputted Homing Attack at low percentages. Like forward throw, it has KO potential, albeit only on with stages with highly positioned platforms, such as Battlefield's top platform."
"1652","Sonic","Down throw","","1% (hits 1-3), 5% (throw)","Pins the opponent to the ground and then Spin Dashes onto them. Due to being a semi-spike, it is reliable for tech-chasing and setting up edge-guards. It resembles the Double Spin from Sonic the Fighters."
"1653","Sonic","Floor attack (front)","","6%","Spin Dashes around in a circular motion while getting up."
"1654","Sonic","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Performs a legsweep while getting up."
"1655","Sonic","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Performs a legsweep while getting up."
"1656","Sonic","Edge attack","","9%","Spin Dashes forward while climbing up. It resembles the Cliffhanger Flip from Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball."
"1657","Sonic","Neutral special","Homing Attack","7%-20%","Curls up into a ball while briefly ascending, homes onto the nearest opponent, and then rams into them. Pressing the special button will execute the move earlier, albeit dealing less damage. It can be comboed into from various moves if executed early."
"1658","Sonic","Side special","Spin Dash","7%-10.9% (dash), 5% (initial jump), 3% (jump)","Curls up into a ball, performs a short jump, and then starts rolling toward the opponent at a fast speed. Holding the special button charges it up and increases its speed. In addition to granting intangibility at the start, it boasts impressive combo potential, thanks to its ability to be followed up with any aerial attack. However, if uncharged, it stops when it hits a shield, making it very unsafe if shielded. It also boasts horizontal recovery potential when it is jump-canceled immediately upon releasing the special button; this turns the dash into a ""Spin Shot"", a quick, long-ranged short hop that can be performed either on the ground or in the air."
"1659","Sonic","Up special","Spring Jump","— (jump), 4% (spring)","Pulls out a spring and uses it to springboard into the air. Although it is primarily used for recovering, it is also useful for partaking in combos. It grants intangibility at the start, while the spring itself can also be used to gimp recovering opponents underneath Sonic."
"1660","Sonic","Down special","Spin Charge","1.5%-2.3% (loop), 4% (last hit), 6% (jump)","A Spin Dash that hits multiple times and has more momentum. It also has slightly different aesthetics, and requires button mashing in order to charge. However, it lacks the short jump at the beginning, cannot be canceled in any way, and it can only become a ""Spin Shot"" when used in the air."
"1661","Sonic","Final Smash","Super Sonic","12% (Chaos Emeralds), 6% (each ram), 10% (detransformation)","Gathers the Chaos Emeralds and uses them to attain his Super Transformation from the Sonic the Hedgehog games. When activated while very close to an opponent, the Chaos Emeralds will damage the opponent. Upon being activated, Sonic is invincible during its duration, and flies around rapidly horizontally and can change his horizontal position. Sonic turning normal again also deals damage to opponents is near him."
"1662","Mega Man","Neutral attack","Mega Buster","2% (shot), 1% (buster)","Mega Man fires up to three shots from his Mega Buster, which have a fairly long range but do little knockback. The pellets have very high priority, being able to even nullify Corrin's Dragon Fang Shot in one go. The move has a sweetspot around the Mega Buster itself."
"1663","Mega Man","Forward tilt","Mega Buster","2%","Behaves identically to Mega Man's neutral attack, except the Mega Buster itself has no hitbox, and Mega Man fires while running forwards. Jumping after firing twice will immediately transition to neutral aerial, and can combo consistently as well."
"1664","Mega Man","Up tilt","Mega Upper","17% (clean), 12% (mid), 8% (late)","A quick rising uppercut. For a tilt, it has incredible power, with the sweetspot having as much power as some smash attacks and being able to reliably KO medium-light characters under 80%. It has little starting lag but very high ending lag and little horizontal range. Based on a maneuver of the same name Mega Man received in Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters."
"1665","Mega Man","Down tilt","Sliding","8% (clean), 5% (late)","Mega Man's signature sliding kick attack. He slides forward with a kick that has very little startup and is the only tilt attack in the game to have sex kick properties. the hitbox lasts all the way until the slide is finished, which can hit opponents attempting to roll away. A good surprise move, but only if not overused. The actual sliding ability introduced in Mega Man 3 is a non-damaging maneuver, though said ability becomes weaponized with the Charge Kick, Charge Man's weapon in Mega Man 5. Additionally, it could be based on the Leg Breaker maneuver Mega Man can use in the secret fighting game mode in Mega Man 7."
"1666","Mega Man","Dash attack","Top Spin","1.2% (hits 1-7), 4% (hit 8)","Mega Man boosts forwards while spinning, damaging whatever he touches. Good priority and long lasting, equivalent to Luigi's dash attack. Useful for mindgames against shields due to its high shield stun, which often makes opponents drop their shield too early. Small noticeable ending lag. Based on Top Man's weapon from Mega Man 3."
"1667","Mega Man","Forward smash","Charge Shot","11.5%-14.95%","Mega Man charges up energy in his Mega Buster, before firing off a bigger and more powerful burst. Like regular Mega Buster shots, this shot disappears after traveling a moderate distance, though this distance was buffed in Ultimate. The longer it is charged, the further the resulting shot will go, and its size, damage and knockback also increase significantly when it is fully charged. Fully charged, this is the longest-reaching forward smash in the game, although it has travel time to compensate. However, it is also the weakest forward smash in the game knockback-wise, with the fully charged attack not even KOing until around 100% from center stage. Based on the Super Mega Buster's Charge Shot from Mega Man 4 onwards, but resembles its appearance  in Mega Man 5."
"1668","Mega Man","Up smash","Spark Shock","2% (hit 1), 1.5% (hits 2-6), 6% (hit 7)","Mega Man turns both of his hands into electrodes, creating a powerful multi-hitting surge of electricity above him. It is overall useful due to its large hitbox, anti-air properties and quick startup, though it has noticeable ending lag. Based on Spark Man's weapon from Mega Man 3, though it is more based on how Spark Man uses the weapon."
"1669","Mega Man","Down smash","Flame Blast","17% (clean), 14% (mid), 9% (late)","Mega Man plants both arm cannons into the ground, causing two vertical flaming pillars to erupt from the ground either side of him which launch the opponent upwards. It has quick startup, but notoriously long endlag that leaves it highly punishable if not landed. Immense knockback when hit with the first frames of the hitbox, which can KO starting at 60% when fully charged. It boasts incredible power, being one of the strongest down smashes in the game. It is based on Flame Man's weapon from Mega Man 6, though it is more based on how Flame Man uses the weapon."
"1670","Mega Man","Neutral aerial","Mega Buster","2% (shot), 2% (buster)","Behaves identically to Mega Man's neutral attack, except Mega Man fires while jumping or falling in the air much like in his original games. The move has a sweetspot on the Mega Buster. Due to Mega Man's effective aerial movement, his neutral attack can be used as a very effective ""wall"" to deny approaches. This is the only aerial attack in the game with no autocancel threshold, as to seamlessly combo into neutral attack or forward tilt."
"1671","Mega Man","Forward aerial","Flame Sword","8% (clean), 8.5% (clean tip), 5% (late)","Mega Man quickly summons a flaming sword to his hand and swings it downwards in front of him. It is a very useful combo move, and can net KOs fairly well at the edge of the stage. As a result, is extremely versatile. It is based on Sword Man's weapon from Mega Man 8."
"1672","Mega Man","Back aerial","Slash Claw","3% (hit 1), 4% (hit 2), 5% (hit 3)","Mega Man quickly turns around and swings his arm, generating three crescent-shaped energy trails behind him. Has high knockback and high speed, able to net KOs when edgeguarding, and can chain into itself at low percents. Cancelling it into the ground before the third hit connects can allow Mega Man to get a grab or even an up tilt KO. It is based on Slash Man's weapon from Mega Man 7."
"1673","Mega Man","Up aerial","Air Shooter","3% (hits 1-3), 2% (hits 4-6), 1% (hits 7-11), 2% (hit 12)","Mega Man fires a small tornado straight above him. It travels a fair distance, drawing in opponents who touch the tornado. It is based on Air Man's weapon from Mega Man 2. It can easily Star KO opponents even at low percentages, especially if the opponent tries to jump out of it. However, it will meteor smash Mega Man himself if it is reflected. Excellent for damage racking."
"1674","Mega Man","Down aerial","Hard Knuckle","14% (clean), 12% (late)","Mega Man points his fist straight downwards and fires it downwards as a short-ranged projectile. The fist deals the most damage in the first few frames, but afterwards, it turns into an aerial-only meteor smash. Mega Man can move himself left or right slightly during the first few frames before launching the fist. Has a weak floating effect before firing. It is based on Hard Man's weapon from Mega Man 3."
"1675","Mega Man","Grab","Super Arm","—","Mega Man grabs his opponent with one hand and lifts them over his head. Decently fast, but has  short range. It is based on Guts Man's weapon from the original Mega Man."
"1676","Mega Man","Pummel","","1.3%","Mega Man squeezes his opponent with his Super Arm."
"1677","Mega Man","Forward throw","","8%","Throws the opponent forward. Low base knockback."
"1678","Mega Man","Back throw","","11%","Mega Man turns around and throws the opponent behind him. It is a very solid KOing throw, being able to KO middleweights at around 110% at the edge."
"1679","Mega Man","Up throw","","7%","Throws the opponent upward. Can KO opponents at very high percentages, but it's mostly used for pressuring with up air."
"1680","Mega Man","Down throw","","4.5%","Throws the opponent downward. The opponent flies straight up after hitting the ground. His primary combo throw."
"1681","Mega Man","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Sweep kicks in a circle around himself."
"1682","Mega Man","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Does the same sweep kick as his front floor attack, but hits behind Mega Man first instead of his front."
"1683","Mega Man","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Mega Man kicks both feet out while spinning."
"1684","Mega Man","Edge attack","","9%","Mega Man jumps up and performs a kick in a similar fashion as his down tilt."
"1685","Mega Man","Neutral special","Metal Blade","5% (spawn), 3% (item throw)","A spinning saw blade projectile that can be thrown in one of eight different directions. The blade can be picked up and thrown by players like a regular item, though it deals less damage upon being thrown a second time. Mega Man cannot throw another Metal Blade until his previous one disappears. Its fair amount of utility makes this Mega Man's most useful tool for edgeguarding, approaching and spacing, and can even initiate shield break combos. The move is based on Metal Man's weapon from Mega Man 2."
"1686","Mega Man","Side special","Crash Bomber","1% (hits 1-4), 4% (last)","Fires a grappling bomb attached to a drill that latches on to any surface or fighter it touches, before exploding a few seconds later. Much like a Gooey Bomb, it can be transferred between players before it detonates but has a shorter timer and the explosion can be safely shielded. The bomb can travel a good distance until it disappears. Can be used to bait a shield grab, or shot against the stage while recovering to deny edgeguarding. When stuck to a wall, it will detonate as soon as a player gets near it. The move is based on Crash Man's weapon in Mega Man 2."
"1687","Mega Man","Up special","Rush Coil","0%","Mega Man briefly summons his robotic dog companion Rush. A second bounce will make Mega Man jump even higher than the first bounce. Other players will also be able to bounce on Rush, even if he is in the air. Mega Man is unable to summon Rush again until he lands, or is hit by an attack after using it. It's possible to get incredibly early KOs by forcing an opponent into the air, and following up with an up air. The move is based on the Rush Coil from Mega Man 3."
"1688","Mega Man","Down special","Leaf Shield","1.5% (circling), 3.8% (thrown)","Mega Man summons leaf-shaped units that electromagnetically orbit around him. The leaves block projectiles, and can be held around Mega Man for a set time. The move is based on Wood Man's weapon from Mega Man 2."
"1689","Mega Man","Final Smash","Mega Legends","3% (init), 41.2% (attack)","Mega Man fires a Black Hole Bomb, Galaxy Man's weapon from Mega Man 9, in front of him. After it explodes, it can suck opponents in. If anyone gets sucked in, then Mega Man X, MegaMan.EXE, Mega Man Volnutt, and Geo Stelar, all protagonists of their own spin-off series, alongside Proto Man and Bass, will join Mega Man to fire their Mega Busters in unison in a cinematic Final Smash."
"1690","Pac-Man","Neutral attack","","2%","Two punches, followed by a bicycle kick. Comes out quickly (All hits are frame 4), but the third hit has some endlag, and little knockback."

"1693","Pac-Man","Forward tilt","","8%","Pac-Man kicks forward, throwing his arms back with an angered expression. Very quick (frame 5), and can kill around 160% at the edge. However, it does possess decent endlag (FAF 31), making it unsafe on shield at close range."
"1694","Pac-Man","Up tilt","","6.5%","Punches upward, hopping up slightly. Has decent vertical range, with low vertical knockback and minimal ending lag (Frame 7, FAF 25), making it good to start or extend combos. Pac-Man's fist has intangibility from frames 7 to 10. Cannot hit Pac-Man's sides, however, making it only usable as an anti-air or niche ledge coverage option."
"1695","Pac-Man","Down tilt","","6%","Pac-Man changes into his Classic Form and chomps downward. Has long range since Pac-Man moves forward at a far distance and once the move finishes, he returns back to his original position, making down tilt a safe poking tool."
"1696","Pac-Man","Dash attack","PAC Dash Bite","2% (hits 1-3), 4% (hit 4)","Pac-Man changes into his Classic Form and slides forward, chomping repeatedly. Hits four times, with the last hit having low vertical knockback. This move has a long animation, but almost no ending lag (FAF 46, while the last hit comes out frame 37), making it incredibly safe (even against shield). One of Pac-Man's best approach options."
"1697","Pac-Man","Forward smash","","15% (sour), 16% (sweet), 8% (late)","Reels back before throwing Blinky (the red ghost) in front of him. Has a sourspot on his arm, while the ghost itself is the sweetspot. Just like his other smash attacks, it can nullify projectiles. Deals respectable damage and high knockback, and has a long-lasting late hitbox. Has 26 frames of ending lag (FAF 53), however, and its long duration makes it easy to punish if not used properly."
"1698","Pac-Man","Up smash","","3% (launcher), 14% (Inky), 7% (late)","Balances on one foot while throwing Inky (the cyan ghost) upward. Has a launcher hitbox in front of him. Also has a long-lasting late hitbox. Has decent knockback, but struggles to kill at higher percents, approaching 130%. His fastest smash attack, coming out on frame 11 (With the second hit on frame 15), with an FAF of 50 and 24 frames of ending lag, making it his most reliable."
"1699","Pac-Man","Down smash","","13% (clean), 6% (late)","Crouches while throwing Pinky and Clyde (the pink and orange ghosts respectively) to either side. The weakest of Pac-Man's smashes, but it sends at a very low angle (29°) for gimps. Also has the highest ending lag of his smashes (FAF 55), with 29 frames of lag, making it unsafe to use outside of punishing rolls, although it has impressive range."
"1700","Pac-Man","Neutral aerial","","10% (clean), 6% (late)","Spins around in his Classic Form. Very fast (frame 3), and lasts a long time. Very little landing lag and knockback, so it is good for combos, but has high ending lag in the air (FAF 52). Autocancels in a full hop."
"1701","Pac-Man","Forward aerial","","7.65%","A roundhouse kick in front of him. Extremely fast (frame 5), with very little ending/landing lag (FAF 26, 10 frames of landing lag), making it interruptible 17 frames after the hitbox ends and is one of, if not the fastest of its type. Can chain into itself, or other moves effectively for combos due to its excellent frame data, average damage output, high base knockback and very low knockback scaling and autocancels in a short hop fast fall. All this attributes make it one of Pac-Man's best moves and a good approach option."
"1702","Pac-Man","Back aerial","","11.8% (clean), 7% (late)","A dropkick behind himself. Decently fast (frame 9, FAF 41) and autocancels in a short hop, but has decent landing lag (13 frames) and mediocre knockback for an aerial of its type. Pac-Man's most reliable killing aerial."
"1703","Pac-Man","Up aerial","","10%","A sweeping bicycle kick above Pac-Man, similar to the Flip Kick from Pac-Man World 2. Decently fast startup and very long duration (frame 9-16), and has little knockback, and somewhat low ending lag (FAF 37) with 20 frames of lag. It autocancels in a short hop and it also is the only aerial in the game which can perform a functional drop cancel."
"1704","Pac-Man","Down aerial","","2% (hits 1-3), 7% (hit 4)","Stomps below himself four times, with the last hit sending diagonally. Has massive base knockback, able to kill reliably below 50% close to the blast zone. Onstage, though, it does not kill until after 150% due to its mediocre knockback scaling. Pac-Man's most damaging aerial if all hits connect and is very good for edgeguarding."
"1705","Pac-Man","Grab","","—","Pac-Man holds his hand out to produce a long tractor beam (based on Galaga). A tether grab, but cannot be used to grab ledges. Pac-Man appears disappointed if he doesn't grab an opponent.  Noticeable startup(Standing: Frame 12, FAF 59. Dash: Frame 14, FAF 67. Pivot: Frame 15, FAF 62), but lasts a long time, has quite far reach and low ending lag for a tether grab."
"1706","Pac-Man","Pummel","","1.3%","Slams his head into the opponent."
"1707","Pac-Man","Forward throw","","8%","Reels back, then tosses the opponent at a 58° angle. Too much ending lag to combo, and too little knockback to kill, but can be used for mixups due to its awkward launch angle ."
"1708","Pac-Man","Back throw","","11%","Similar to Mario and Wario's, though it does not have a collateral hitbox. Grabs opponent and swings them around twice, throwing them behind on the second spin. Kills around 140% on the ledge. Pac-Man's most damaging throw, and his only reliable kill throw."
"1709","Pac-Man","Up throw","","5%","Swings his arm upward to throw the opponent into the sky. Has little knockback and endlag so it can combo, and kills around 220%."
"1710","Pac-Man","Down throw","","1.5% (hits 1-3), 6% (hit 4)","Changes into his Classic Form and chomps the opponent four times, with the last hit dealing low knockback. Sends at a low angle for techchases, but has very high ending lag."

"1716","Pac-Man","Side special","Power Pellet","3% (before eating Power Pellet), 4% (uncharged), 12% (fully charged)","Pac-Man summons a string of Pellets in front of him, then chomps along the trail. The string can be angled in any direction and travels very far, making it an incredible recovery option. Also has high knockback if Pac-Man hits the opponent after eating the Power Pellet. Just after eating the final pellet, as well, Pac-Man has Heavy Armor up to 100 knockback units for a short time."
"1717","Pac-Man","Up special","Pac-Jump","5-7% (early), 6-8.42% (mid), 7-10% (late)","Summons a trampoline below him, which will launch Pac-Man higher as it changes color (from blue, to yellow, to red). Any character can jump on the trampoline, but only Pac-Man will be sent into freefall from it. Anybody but Pac-Man himself can harm the trampoline (which sends it into different colors before destroying it entirely). Any character who jumps on a red trampoline will be instantly forced into freefall."
"1718","Pac-Man","Down special","Fire Hydrant","9% (falling), 13% (tumbling)","Summons a Fire Hydrant, which falls downward until it hits the ground. Once grounded, it spurts water out of its sides twice (or on top, if someone is standing on it). This water pushes enemies and items away.

"1719","Pac-Man","Final Smash","Super Pac-Man","20% (yellow), 28% (red)","Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet and a Super Pellet, grows large, and turns into his classic 2D form before looping around the stage repeatedly. He always moves in a straight line, but his angle can be altered to catch opponents running away. As the Final Smash progresses, Pac-Man moves faster and faster, then starts acquiring a red tint, after which he deals more damage to opponents. Ultimately, he slows down before the Final Smash ends."

It launches the opponent diagonally upward, and grants intangibility on Ryu's leg from frames 7-12. Good for following with a dash attack or forward aerial at low percents. It is based on his standing medium kick in Street Fighter III. Cannot be special-cancelled.Tapped (Close): An inward hook. based off his Street Fighter II close medium punch. This move causes the opponent to slightly shift towards Ryu, allowing it to combo into any of his special moves. Even at 999%, this move is incapable of KO'ing. This move can also lock.Held: The overhead of the same name that debuted in Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Despite its appearance, it hits twice much like the original version.

It can be used repeatedly as fast as the player can press the attack button, which allows it to chain into itself and lead into many of Ryu's moves for a quick finisher. Despite its appearance, it has decent range. It is based on his close standing light punch in Street Fighter II.Held: An uppercut. Strong for its speed and grants his upper body intangibility from frames 4-10, making it a surprisingly effective anti-air attack and KO move. If it connects, it can instantly be canceled into any version of Shoryuken. A reliable finisher for his tapped up tilt. KOs at 152%.

It can be repeated as fast as the player can press, similar to his other tapped tilts. If used on a prone opponent, they will be lightly launched back onto their feet, allowing Ryu to continue combos on them for extended periods of time. It is based on his crouching light kick in Street Fighter II.Held: A lunging, Hapkido-style shin kick. Despite having low power, it can be immediately canceled into a special move only if Ryu hits the opponent or their shield, allowing Ryu to pressure his opponent. Shoryuken combos well from this attack. It is based on his crouching medium kick in Street Fighter II."

"1728","Ryu","Forward smash","Joudan Sokutogeri[3]","16% (leg), 17.5% (foot)","The side kick of the same name from Street Fighter III. Moves him slightly forward and has the highest range of all his standard attacks, as it is able to hit opponents two character lengths away from him. However, it has noticeable ending lag. Deals slightly more damage and knockback when hit with Ryu's heel, and is Ryu's strongest standard attack if his heel connects. KOs at 110% with his heel and 120% anywhere else. Can cancel into his Final Smash upon hit."
"1729","Ryu","Up smash","","17% (clean), 13.5% (late)","Squats and then rises up to throw an uppercut. Makes his hurtbox smaller while attacking, making this a good anti-air attack. Slight ending lag and does not have much horizontal range. His arm becomes intangible on frames 3-6. A good finisher for his tap combos. KOs at 130%. Can cancel into his Final Smash upon hit. It is based on his crouching heavy punch in Street Fighter, albeit with its animation from Street Fighter III."
"1730","Ryu","Down smash","","16%","A legsweep. Launches opponents at a diagonal angle and unlike most down smashes, it only hits in one direction. Has the fastest start-up of all of his smash attacks, with more range than his up smash but less than his forward smash, making it also his safest smash attack at a distance. However, it has below average knockback for a smash attack, which makes it unreliable as a KOing option. Instead, it functions better as a spacing and anti-pressure option. Like his other smash attacks, it works well as a good finisher for his tapped combos. Can cancel into his Final Smash upon hit. It is based on his crouching heavy kick in Street Fighter II."
"1731","Ryu","Neutral aerial","","8% (clean), 4.5% (late)","A downward angled knee strike. Its limited range is compensated by its sex kick properties and low ending lag.

Ryu's foot has high launching power, while his upper leg has a sourspot and deals less damage. Despite this, the sourspot deals high shield damage. A good combo move and very damaging for its speed, but lacks KO power due to its knockback growth, making it more suitable for damage racking unless near the side blast lines. Can cancel into any of his special moves upon hit. It is based on his diagonal jumping medium and heavy kick animation in Street Fighter II."
"1733","Ryu","Back aerial","","16% (leg), 13% (foot)","An outside crescent kick. Though it has a small hitbox, its strength and fast start-up make it Ryu's most powerful aerial and a viable KOing option. KOs at 115%. Due to Ryu always facing his opponent in one-on-one matches, it is difficult to use for edgeguarding: one must perform a reverse aerial rush, which takes longer to perform as Ryu, as he will only pivot around as part of his turnaround, and not in a dash dance (without performing a reverse aerial rush, it is impossible to jump offstage while facing towards it if the opponent is offstage). It is based on his vertical jumping heavy kick from Street Fighter II, which in some sources also doubled as his Senpuukyaku (<U+65CB><U+98A8><U+811A>, ""Whirlwind Leg"") command normal/unique art from other games."
"1734","Ryu","Up aerial","Sukui Tsuki[5]","5% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","An uppercut. Despite its appearance, it hits twice, has good vertical range, and is reliable at catching opponents above Ryu.

"1735","Ryu","Down aerial","Straight Punch","12% (grounded opponent), 15% (aerial opponent sweetspot), 11% (aerial opponent sourspot)","A downward angled cross. Hitting an airborne opponent with the attack's sweetspot (his fist as it comes down) results in a meteor smash that powerfully sends opponents diagonally downward, while hitting an airborne opponent with the sourspot launches the opponent diagonally upward with high knockback. Hitting a grounded opponent, however, results in extremely low knockback that will not KO even at 300%, but nonetheless possesses the ability to start combos. Can cancel into any of his special moves upon hit. It is based on his jumping medium and heavy punch in Street Fighter II, albeit at an emphasized downward angle."
"1736","Ryu","Grab","","—","Reaches out. Ryu's overall grab range is short. It is based on his grab animation in Street Fighter III."
"1737","Ryu","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike while holding the opponent in the collar-and-elbow position. It is based on Ken's Tsukami Hizageri (<U+3064><U+304B><U+307F><U+819D><U+8E74><U+308A>, ""Grasping Knee Kick"") throw in the Street Fighter Alpha/Zero games."
"1738","Ryu","Forward throw","","9%","The seoi nage[6] (a Judo throw). If the opponent does not react, this throw can lead into a down aerial meteor smash at medium percentages. It is based on his punch throw in Street Fighter II, where it had the same name in most in-depth sources."
"1739","Ryu","Back throw","Somersault Throw","12%","The tomoe nage[7] (a Judo throw). Heavy opponents can be knocked back onto their feet with a tapped down tilt, then thrown again. It is based on his kick throw in Street Fighter II, where it had the same name in most in-depth sources."
"1740","Ryu","Up throw","Heel Drop","8% (throw), 15% (kick)","A stretch kick transitioned into an axe kick. It can combo into an aerial attack at low percents. While the axe kick cannot hit the thrown opponent, it can nevertheless hit another opponent that is too close to Ryu. Unlike the stretch kick, the axe kick deals much more damage and has high knockback (KO's Mario starting at 77% from the edge of Final Destination). Ryu's leg becomes intangible during the axe kick (frames 25-30). It is based on his close heavy kick in Street Fighter II."
"1741","Ryu","Down throw","","5% (hit), 4% (throw)","Pins the opponent to the ground and performs a knifehand strike. Its angle allows it to combo well into aerial attacks and Shoryuken until 30%, where thrown opponents are launched too high to get hit. Deals immense shield damage, enough to instantly break the shield of opponents that are right next to Ryu. Based on the brick breaking bonus game in Street Fighter, though it also resembles Akuma's Shuretto (<U+6731><U+88C2><U+5200>, ""Vermilion Rending Blade"") throw in Street Fighter IV."

Only one Hadoken can be active, as attempting to shoot another results in a puff of smoke emitting from his hands. Holding down the special button greatly increases the blast's speed and slightly increases damage output. Three versions of the move can be performed, two of which have directional inputs: a small blue Hadoken (special button only), a minutely stronger and larger inputted Hadoken (<U+2193> <U+2198> <U+2192> + attack/special), and the red flaming Shakunetsu Hadoken that hits multiple times (<U+2190> <U+2199> <U+2193> <U+2198> <U+2192> + attack/special). Combos well out of his tapped tilt attacks and aerials, and is mainly used to rack up damage and control space due to its low knockback. The light version travels extremely slowly and can be used to control space and even start combos while approaching, while the heavy version is extremely fast and is useful for zoning. Shakunetsu Hadoken deals some shield damage, though not to the extent of his Collarbone Breaker. However, the Hadoken and its variants should be used wisely due to its low priority. All variants can cancel into his Final Smash."
"1747","Ryu","Side special","Tatsumaki Senpukyaku","9%, 10%, 11% (Standard); 10.4%, 11.5%, 12.4% (Input)","A jumping, spinning crescent kick. Ryu moves in the given direction he is facing. Has sex kick properties, grants intangibility on Ryu's leg for the whole duration the hitbox is active, and deals more damage and knockback after the first few frames. Holding down the special button increases damage dealt, distance traveled, and the move's duration, also giving the attack additional knockback. Using an inputted Tatsumaki Senpukyaku (<U+2193> <U+2199> <U+2190> + attack/special) sees Ryu announce the move by name and results in it dealing even more damage, covering more distance, and granting it better KOing potential. The move can be used as a good horizontal recovery while not causing helplessness, but it can only be used once in the air without touching the ground. Essentially, it is a high risk, high reward option for approaching and recovering. Can cancel into his Final Smash."
"1748","Ryu","Up special","Shoryuken","13%, 14%, 15% (Standard, grounded);12%, 13%, 14% (Standard, early air);7% (Standard, late air);15.6%, 16.8%, 18% (Input, grounded);14.4%, 15.6%, 16.8% (Input, early air);8.4% (Input, late air)","A leaping uppercut. Upon usage, Ryu announces the move's name while propelling his fist into the air at high speed. Holding the special button increases damage and height traveled. However, it has heavy aerial lag once the hitbox ceases. An inputted Shoryuken (<U+2192> <U+2193> <U+2198> + attack/special) deals even more knockback and damage and grants Ryu both slightly more intangibility (frames 1-14 versus frame 5) and lower landing lag (16 frames versus 23 frames). Aside from being his main vertical recovery move, Shoryuken is also a viable KOing option due to its fast start-up, especially when used in conjunction with Focus Attack. In comparison, an inputted Shoryuken is Ryu's most powerful vertical KOing option overall and has the highest growth in his entire standard moveset. Ryu becomes helpless as he descends with the move's high aerial lag. Can cancel into his Final Smash."
"1749","Ryu","Down special","Focus Attack","12% (Level 1), 10% (Level 2), 17% (Level 3)","Assumes a focused stance while emitting a black ink-like aura, and then throws a short straight-punch. Crumples opponents where they stand with a lengthy stun animation if charged for more than half a second, which can allow for follow-ups. Ryu gains super armor that can withstand a single hit while it is charging. When fully charged, the attack becomes unblockable and will pierce through counterattacks. Ryu can also perform a technique called the Focus Attack Dash Cancel. This is performed by tapping left or right twice, which cancels Focus Attack and instead propels Ryu a set distance depending on where the control stick was tapped. However if the punch misses, Ryu will be unable to cancel the move. If the move hits an airborne opponent, they will instead by launched with heavy hitlag. The move's charge is indicated by Ryu flashing during its start-up. Level 1 is performed immediately and slightly launches an opponent. Level 2 is performed after half a second and crumples an opponent, but deals the least amount of damage. Level 3 is performed after a whole second, can block any normal single hit attack, crumples the opponent for a much longer time and deals the most amount of damage. Although Focus Attack cannot block grabs and is countered by multiple hit attacks, it is a useful tool for baiting opponents and punishing, while its Dash Cancel can function as a horizontal recovery oprion while offstage."

At point-blank range, Ryu traps the opponent with the Shin Shoryuken, a three-hit combo that launches the opponent with an even stronger Shoryuken. Begins KOing at specific percentages for every character, much like KO Uppercut and Finishing Touch. At any other range, Ryu performs the Shinku Hadoken, a much larger Hadoken that vacuums nearby opponents into it before dragging them a distance across the screen and exploding. Shin Shoryuken has much higher KO potential against a single opponent, whereas Shinku Hadoken has more range, reliably affects multiple opponents, and is capable of bypassing walls. Shin Shoryuken can be cancelled into from Ryu's neutral attacks (both tapped and held variants), tilts, smash attacks, aerials, and special moves (for the variants of Hadoken, it must be at point blank range)."
"1751","Cloud","Neutral attack","","2.5%","A side kick, followed by a mid-level roundhouse kick, followed by an outward slash. All hits are executed very quickly and have high range (particularly the kicks). The last hit can be used to tech-chase due to its low semi-spike knockback, but it's slow to end. The first two hits can jab lock, although its rather high hitbox placement makes this difficult to accomplish."

The first two hits can jab lock, although its rather high hitbox placement makes this difficult to accomplish."
"1754","Cloud","Forward tilt","","11%","An inward slash. It has quick start-up, but moderate ending lag, making it punishable on shield unless spaced. It is Cloud's only tilt that has decent KO potential, KOing middleweights around 120% at the edge. It is based on his basic attack in Final Fantasy VII."
"1755","Cloud","Up tilt","","8%","An overhead arcing slash. Its hitbox starts behind Cloud with a larger front hitbox, although it does not extend beside Cloud and makes it unable to hit smaller characters beside him. It is fast and has a fairly large hitbox, although its knockback is lacking. It can reliably start combos, chaining into itself at 0% and into aerials at low-mid percentages."
"1756","Cloud","Down tilt","Sliding","6% (knee), 7% (leg)","A baseball slide. His legs are intangible while the hitbox is active, and it will sometimes deal less damage if landed early. It has very quick start-up, propels Cloud a good distance forward, launches opponents vertically, and significantly lowers his hurtbox. Altogether, these traits make it useful as an approach and punishment option, as well as a capable set-up option into aerial attacks."
"1757","Cloud","Dash attack","","11% (clean), 8% (late)","Thrusts the sharp edge of the Buster Sword forward while holding it diagonally. It deals more damage at the beginning, has a lingering hitbox and its moderately high knockback enables it to KO at high percentages."
"1758","Cloud","Forward smash","Triple Buster","3% (hit 1), 2% (hit 2 center), 3% (hit 2 hilt), 4% (hit 2 tip), 12% (hit 3 tip), 13% (hit 3 non-tip)","Performs three extremely fast slashes in front of himself. The first two hits combo into the third, which has higher range and immense knockback. It is Cloud's strongest non-Limit Break move, KOing middleweights around 100% at center-stage, but it has rather slow startup, high ending lag, and deals below average shieldstun. Additionally, each hit is only active for one frame, which means it can be dodged entirely with a well-timed roll or sidestep. It resembles the depiction of Cross Slash in the Kingdom Hearts series, and may also be a reference to the effects of the Double Cut Materia in Final Fantasy VII."
"1759","Cloud","Up smash","","13% (early/tip), 12% (mid/hilt), 8% (late)","Swings the Buster Sword upward in a wide arc. Has some startup (15 frames) and moderate ending lag, and its KO power is only average compared to most other up smashes, but it has deceptively large range, being able to function as an effective anti-air. KOs middleweights around 125%."
"1760","Cloud","Down smash","Double Thrust","3% (hit 1), 11% (hit 2)","Kneels and thrusts the Buster Sword's hilt forward, then performs a reverse gripped thrust behind himself. The first hit launches opponents into the second, though it is possible to tech after the first hit, causing the second to miss. The first hit can stage spike with ease due to its angle, while the second hit is a semi-spike, making it useful for launching opponents with weak horizontal recoveries off-stage. It hits on frame 8, making it Cloud's fastest smash attack, and a decent close-range out of shield option."
"1761","Cloud","Neutral aerial","","8%","A circular slash around himself. While its range is somewhat lacking compared to Cloud's other attacks, it is his fastest aerial nonetheless and covers his whole hurtbox decently well. Autocancels in a short hop."
"1762","Cloud","Forward aerial","Meteor Slash","14% (clean sweetspot), 13% (clean sourspot), 11% (late)","Briefly pauses and then performs a downward slash. It is his slowest aerial to start, hitting on frame 18, but a sweetspot on the middle of the blade as it comes down powerfully meteor smashes aerial opponents. Grounded opponents are sent at a more vertical angle by the sweetspot. If contact is made once the blade stops, it deals weaker knockback. Its ending lag is moderate, though its landing lag is low for its range and power, and it autocancels from a full hop. On landing, its sweetspot in grounded opponents can act as a situational combo starter. It closely resembles Braver, Cloud's initial Limit Break in Final Fantasy VII."
"1763","Cloud","Back aerial","","13%","Turns around to perform an outward slash. Has very long range and good knockback, KOing middleweights at around 115% near the edge, making it an effective spacing and KO option. It also has very low landing lag, autocancels from a short hop, and can be used to perform a wall of pain at low percentages. It has limited vertical range, however, and its hitbox is only active for three frames. It resembles the sword strike he does during his Meteorain Limit Break."
"1764","Cloud","Up aerial","","11% (clean), 8% (late)","Thrusts the sharp edge of the Buster Sword's blade upward while holding it parallel to the ground. Has sex kick properties. While it has rather moderate startup, it works as an excellent combo starter on landing, being able to combo into most of Cloud's moves especially at low percentages, while its late hit can set up KO confirms into Limit Cross Slash and Finishing Touch. It also autocancels relatively early, and its large, lingering hitbox makes it an effective anti-air and punishment tool. It also boasts respectable knockback by itself, with its clean hit KOing near the upper blast line at around 140%."
"1765","Cloud","Down aerial","","13% (clean aerial sourspot, grounded opponent), 15% (aerial sweetspot), 8% (late)","A downward thrust. Striking directly beneath Cloud with the first few frames meteor smashes aerial opponents. Its late hit is a capable combo starter when autocancelled (from a full hop, but right before he reaches the apex), which even has certain KO confirms at high percentages. It has a long duration, but also has high ending lag, making it a huge risk to use off-stage. Despite its meteor-smashing capabilities, it is rather quick, coming out on frame 11, allowing it to be a potential followup option."
"1766","Cloud","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his hand. Has very low range."
"1767","Cloud","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike. Rather good speed."
"1768","Cloud","Forward throw","","4% (hit 1), 3% (throw)","A modified dropsault. It has low knockback, so it's usually used for positioning or throwing opponents off-stage. It resembles Somersault, a Limit Break used by Tifa Lockhart, one of Cloud's party members in Final Fantasy VII."
"1769","Cloud","Back throw","","3% (hit 1), 3% (throw)","A spinning back kick. At lower percentages, it is capable of tech-chasing with Blade Beam or his dash attack against middleweights and heavyweights. Has weak knockback, making it only suitable for positioning and edgeguard setups"
"1770","Cloud","Up throw","","2% (hit 1), 2.5% (hit 2), 4% (throw)","Cloud sets the opponent above him and butterfly-kicks them. While it has high enough knockback to set up juggles, it is unable to KO at reasonable percentages, and should the opponent be in the middle of the stage and be at such percentages (around 215% for middleweights), up throw will be more effective at KOing. It vaguely resembles Tifa's Waterkick Limit Break, albeit kicking vertically instead of horizontally."
"1771","Cloud","Down throw","","7%","A one-handed body slam. It launches opponents behind him with low base knockback; it is Cloud's only combo throw, though it is a lackluster one. It also KOs earlier than any of his other throws, at around 181% for middleweights with Cloud facing away the edge of Battlefield. It resembles Tifa's Meteor Strike Limit Break, albeit performed while grounded instead of in the air."
"1772","Cloud","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings the Buster Sword around himself before getting up."
"1773","Cloud","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings the Buster Sword around himself before getting up."
"1774","Cloud","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings the Buster Sword around himself before getting up."

"1776","Cloud","Neutral special","Blade Beam","8% (grounded clean), 6% (grounded late), 6.4% (aerial clean), 4.8% (aerial late), 6% (Limit Break hit 1), 2% (Limit Break hits 2-6), 3% (Limit Break hit 7)","Swings the Buster Sword upward and in front of himself in order to launch a green, crescent-shaped energy beam as a projectile. It comes out and moves rather slowly, but travels a long distance and has a large hitbox. It is stronger if used on the ground and hit early. The aerial version is slower and deals less damage, but gives Cloud a slight lift. Like most projectiles, it disappears on contact with an object or enemy.
The Limit Break variant possesses transcendent priority, moves much faster across the ground and hits multiple times, with its last hit having great KO potential. It is still weaker and slower when performed in midair, however. Upon hitting a wall, the Limit Break variant will not disappear and instead activate as if hitting a player, making it an effective stage-spiking tool if preformed under the ledge. However, this is rather risky and considering Cloud's poor recovery."
"1777","Cloud","Side special","Cross Slash","4% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2-4), 6% (hit 5), 5% (Limit Break hit 1), 3% (Limit Break hits 2-4), 10% (Limit Break hit 5)","Performs a downwards slash. On contact with an enemy, pressing the special button allows this slash to transition into a series of follow-up slashes, together spelling the kanji <U+51F6> (""misfortune""). The full attack deals high damage and moderate knockback, making it a superb punishing option at close range. It is weak against shield, however, as all stages of the attack are slow and punishable if missed.
Its Limit Break variant results in Cloud unleashing all five strikes with a single input regardless of whether he hits anything. It also noticeably increases both the damage and KO potential of the move, KOing middleweights at 100% from the center of the stage, while reducing the move's ending lag to such an extent that it becomes nearly impossible to punish without being right behind Cloud as he unleashes the move. Additionally, Limit Cross Slash deals a high amount of shield damage, so much so that the final hit can sometimes break a middleweight's shield, making it risky to be near Cloud during Limit Break. It is commonly considered Cloud's most effective Limit Break move due to its abundance of positive traits."
"1778","Cloud","Up special","Climhazzard","3% (hit 1), 4% (hits 2-3), 3.5% (landing), 6% (Limit Break hit 1), 7% (Limit Break hit 2)","A leaping reverse gripped slash. If the special button is pressed again, it is followed with a descending reverse gripped slash. The first hit deals set knockback that leads into the second hit, which has a sweetspot at the center of the Buster Sword's blade that meteor smashes opponents as Cloud descends. It is Cloud's primary recovery move, though it is notable for being very ineffective due to multiple traits: it grants mediocre distance with low vertical height and almost no horizontal momentum, and the descending slash cannot be cancelled and isn't able to sweetspot the edge until Cloud has fallen a certain distance with it, making it unsuitable to use offstage. Its fast startup makes it a good surprise attack when grounded, particularly as an out of shield option.
Its Limit Break variant greatly strengthens the first (but not second) hit of the move (allowing it to KO grounded middleweights at around 125%), allows it to sweetspot edges throughout, and grants Cloud much greater vertical and horizontal distance."
"1779","Cloud","Down special","Limit Charge","1% (Finishing Touch)","Holds out the Buster Sword and remains still. This manually charges the Limit Gauge. While the move is being held, a text box labelled ""Limit"" appears above Cloud, which contains a meter that denotes the current level of Limit and increases as it is charged. The Limit Gauge will reach full charge either by using Limit Charge for 400 frames (6.67 seconds), but can be alternatively filled by dealing 150% or receiving 100%, and each of these methods stack with each other. The move can be charge-canceled by pressing the shield button, hitting the control stick left or right (which triggers a roll), grabbing, or pressing the special button again (the latter of which has an 8-frame delay). When the Limit Gauge is filled, Cloud is surrounded by a blue, flame-like energy, and his speed and mobility receive a noticeable increase. As long as he is in this state, he has access to much more powerful, one-use variants of his special attacks, as listed above. Using any of these attacks will empty the Limit Gauge and return Cloud to his normal state, even if the move misses or is interrupted. The charge goes away in 15 seconds if it isn't used at all when fully charged.
The Limit Break variation of Limit Charge itself is an entirely different attack called Finishing Touch; Cloud slashes in an arc around himself, generating a large whirlwind that deals only 1% damage but deals tremendous knockback, enough to KO most opponents before 70%. The move hits on frame 14, but has very high ending lag and almost no shieldstun due to its damage output. The attack is weaker as a whole when performed in the air, however, KOing about 24% later when hit in front, and 36% later with the back hitbox. The attack's hitbox is deceptively large, and it generates a powerful wind that extends even further beyond the Buster Sword's range, pushing opponents away. Finishing Touch's animation may be based on Tornado, an unused Limit Break in Final Fantasy VII."
"1780","Cloud","Final Smash","Omnislash","3% (hit 1), 2% (hits 2-14), 5% (hit 15), 4%-5% (hit 16), 10% (hit 17), 50% (all hits connect)","Rushes forward at high speed and attacks, unleashing a series of slashes that concludes with a powerful, descending slash that triggers an explosion. At the beginning of the move, with a text box appearing above him that displays ""Omnislash"" as he proceeds to flings any opponents he runs into to the top of the screen. After the series of slashes, Cloud charges up a final slash, in which he descends and slashes the opponent downward to the stage and results in a huge explosion that launches the opponent. One of the most powerful Final Smashes in the game when successful, as it can KO as low as 22%. Unlike Marth and Lucina's Critical Hit, Cloud will dash off the edges of platforms if Omnislash is initiated next to one, and he cannot cancel the move."

There is a hitbox on Bayonetta's leg that leads into the main hitbox. It can meteor smash opponents that are either on the edge or in midair, making it a potent edge-guarding option. Like up smash, it only hits in front of her, has high ending lag and low priority, but has considerable vertical range. Madama Butterfly's hitbox cannot be reversed.

When held, Bayonetta instead fires Charge Bullets, which are stronger but only active during the first four shots. The move can be cancelled by shielding or rolling, but only when fully charged. Due to its angle, it is useful for edge-guarding and hindering aerial approaches. Bayonetta alternates between two animations while charging and firing for each time she uses Bullet Climax: either she stands in a semi-crouching position and fires the guns in her hands, or she does a handstand and fires the guns on her feet. Both function identically, although Kirby's Copy Ability fires from noticeably different heights.

If the button is held, Bayonetta will then follow it up with an aú aberto. She will also fire the guns on her feet as she slides. It is her primary combo starter, due to the follow-up kick launching the opponent upward. If the first hit is shielded, however, she will not transition to the aú aberto. She will also be under considerable endlag, leaving her open to punishing.After Burner Kick: In the air, she alternately performs the After Burner Kick, which can be performed twice in a row as long as the first kick connects. If shielded, it can't transition into another After Burner Kick. It can be angled downward by two different methods: holding the control stick down before inputting the move (moving the stick in a quarter-circle), or by flicking the control stick down as soon as the move is inputted but before the move comes out. The second method takes strict timing: if not correctly, she will end up doing the standard After Burner Kick. If the button is held for the standard version, Bayonetta will fire the guns on her feet (one slightly upward, and one slightly downward). Both versions of After Burner Kick are her primary aerial follow-ups.

"1809","Bayonetta","Up special","Witch Twist","3% (ground, hits 1 and 7), 0.2% (hits 2 - 5), 2% (air, hit 1)","An ascending, corkscrew pistol-whip. It hits multiple times but covers minimal vertical distance and extremely minimal horizontal distance, similarly to Rising Uppercut. Despite this, Witch Twist is still a very useful recovery option, as using it after a jump allows Bayonetta to use her double jump, and then use another Witch Twist. Holding the button has Bayonetta fire her guns from her hands and feet; hitting anyone directly above or below, to her sides, and slightly diagonally under her. Based on the technique of the same name from Bayonetta, as well as a variation from Bayonetta 2 known as Witch Strike; the ability to hold guns is taken from the former, but lacks the dodging spinning kick at the start. Otherwise performs identically to the latter, including the ability to use a second one after a double jump. With precise timing (a 3 frame window to be exact), a Double Jump can be cancelled into Witch Twist, thereby saving her jump in a similar way to Smash 4. This drastically improves her combo game and enables some particularly powerful ladder combos, as well as some much needed recovery mix-ups. This can be executed with both the first and second Witch Twists (as long as the double jump is unused) only to use the double jump right after, essentially giving her a maximum of three midair jumps, though only one would reach the top of its arch."
"1810","Bayonetta","Down special","Witch Time","—","Uses her magic to slow down time around an opponent who attacks her. Its duration is dependent on several factors: the opponent's damage (more damage = longer duration), whether the attack was direct or indirect (indirect attacks such as projectiles result in a shorter duration), and frequency (using Witch Time too often will decrease the duration). However, if Witch Time is activated too late, then Bat Within is activated instead. Bat Within teleports Bayonetta in any direction, but unlike in the Bayonetta series, it halves the damage received, rather than negating it. Based on the same ability from the Bayonetta games, albeit only slowing down the attacking opponent as opposed to all opponents."

Once it is filled, she has to deal knockback to any opponent before a cutscene occurs. The cutscene consists of her using her hair as a conduit to summon Gomorrah, who then damages any opponents suffering hitstun from Bayonetta's attacks by chomping them four times before they are launched with set knockback. The attack button can be mashed during the attack to fill a second Climax Gauge that deals an additional 15% after the cutscene. Once the cutscene ends, anyone with 100% or more will be instantly KO'd. Anyone below 100% will take an additional 10% as the Final Smash ends."

"1816","Mii Brawler","Forward tilt","","8%","A roundhouse kick. Can be angled, which deals more damage when angled up or angled down, and is the Brawler's longest ranged tilt. Unlike the version in SSB4, it no longer has a sourspot. As a result, it is useful for creating space."
"1817","Mii Brawler","Forward tilt","","8.3%","A roundhouse kick. Can be angled, which deals more damage when angled up or angled down, and is the Brawler's longest ranged tilt. Unlike the version in SSB4, it no longer has a sourspot. As a result, it is useful for creating space."
"1818","Mii Brawler","Up tilt","","6%","Punches with an uppercut. Sends the opponent upwards and slightly behind the Brawler, which is most noticeable at mid percents. As a result, it can juggle into itself at low percentages, drag the opponent closer for a grounded followup like a tilt, grab or up special, and set up aerial combos at mid percents, including back aerial. The move's hitbox can reach through the lower platforms of Battlefield and can hit prone opponents, but it cannot hit opponents behind the Brawler. Additionally, it has low horizontal range, and usually sends too far to combo after 120%."
"1819","Mii Brawler","Down tilt","","8%","An inverted sweep kick along the ground. Knocks opponents upward, allowing it to combo into tilts or forward aerial at low percents, and aerials or any up special move at medium percents."
"1820","Mii Brawler","Dash attack","","11% (clean), 6% (late)","A flying kick. A risky but useful approach option."
"1821","Mii Brawler","Forward smash","","18%","A strong straight punch. The move moves the Brawler slightly forward. Although an electric trail appears at the Brawler's fist, it does not deal electric damage. It deals immense knockback and easily KOs from 75% at the center of Final Destination. However, it has high startup overall and incredibly high ending lag (hits on frame 17 and ends on frame 67), and its hitbox only lasts for one frame."
"1822","Mii Brawler","Up smash","Cartwheel Kick","14% (clean), 10% (late)","A flip kick. It has high speed (frame 8), which makes it a good anti-air and grounded combo finisher at low percents, and it can KO at around 120%. However, the late hit (after the Brawler completes 3/4 of the backflip) has significantly lower knockback growth and only KOs at around 170%. Like up tilt, its hitbox can reach through the lower platforms of Battlefield."
"1823","Mii Brawler","Down smash","","13%","Punches forwards and kicks backwards simultaneously. Very fast like up smash (frame 9), with the lowest ending lag of all the Brawler's smash attacks (FAF 43). Both sides deal the same damage and knockback. However, both hits have very poor range."
"1824","Mii Brawler","Neutral aerial","","10% (clean), 5% (late)","A sex kick, similar to Mario's neutral aerial. Its extremely high ending lag has been reduced from SSB4. Due to its startup (frame 3) and low landing lag (frame 8), it is a useful combo breaker, and the clean hit can act as a niche KO option at the sides of the stage at around 130%. As of the 2.0.0 patch, neutral aerial's landing lag is low enough for the weak hit to true combo into a multitude of moves, including neutral attack, Thrust Uppercut and Head-On Assault at low percents, or down tilt or Helicopter Kick at mid percents. Autocancels from a full hop."
"1825","Mii Brawler","Forward aerial","","5% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Two alternating inward kicks. The first kick can be used to initiate combos on grounded opponents, but as the kicks transition much faster than in SSB4, it is much more difficult to drag opponents to the ground with the first hit. Additionally, the move's hitboxes are on the Brawler's legs, which can cause it to whiff."
"1826","Mii Brawler","Back aerial","","12%","A swinging back kick. Very fast (frame 7) and is the Brawler's most reliable KO option in midair. Has a small chance of tripping grounded opponents at low percents. However, its hitbox is very brief. Autocancels from a short hop, which allows it to wall out opponents."
"1827","Mii Brawler","Up aerial","","9%","Swipes their foot above their head in an arc. Autocancels from a short hop, has the second lowest ending lag of all the Brawler's aerials (frame 10), and has a wide hitbox; the front hitbox is capable of hitting tall characters out of a short hop (such as Marth). As a result, it is an excellent combo initiator or extender, as a falling up aerial can start grounded combos at low percents, or juggle into itself or any up special move at mid percents."
"1828","Mii Brawler","Down aerial","","13% (clean), 12% (late)","Swings both fists beneath themself in a double axe handle. The clean hit is a powerful meteor smash, and sends grounded opponents diagonally upwards. However, it is the Brawler's slowest aerial in terms of startup lag, ending lag and landing lag. Autocancels from a full hop and double jump fast fall."
"1829","Mii Brawler","Grab","","—","The Brawler reaches in front of themself."
"1830","Mii Brawler","Pummel","","1.3%","Headbutts the opponent."
"1831","Mii Brawler","Forward throw","","9%","Launches the opponent away with a backhand. It is the Brawler's KO throw, though it does so poorly as it KOs at around 144% at the edge of Final Destination."
"1832","Mii Brawler","Back throw","","4% (kick), 5% (throw)","Kicks the opponent behind themself."
"1833","Mii Brawler","Up throw","","11%","Knocks the enemy up with a palm strike. It is the Brawler's most damaging throw and can initiate aerial juggles, though it has no true followup potential due to its ending lag."
"1834","Mii Brawler","Down throw","","2% (chop), 4% (throw)","Karate chops the opponent into the ground. This is the Brawler's combo throw, though it has been significantly nerfed from SSB4 due to it having higher knockback growth. As a result, it is still a reliable combo throw that can be extended into aerials, up special moves, or up aerial chains, though it has lost its potent KO setups at a wide percent range and quickly loses combo potential at high percents."
"1835","Mii Brawler","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Gets up while kicking both sides."
"1836","Mii Brawler","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Same as their frontal floor attack."
"1837","Mii Brawler","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Gets up while kicking both sides."
"1838","Mii Brawler","Edge attack","","9%","A low backhanded karate chop."
"1839","Mii Brawler","Neutral special","Shot Put","15% (no bounce), 11.25% (first bounce), 8.4% (second bounce)","A shot put is thrown into the air as an arcing projectile. Bounces twice upon landing, which deals lower damage; if it misses, the shot travels a set distance before disappearing. Very damaging and strong for an unchargeable projectile, which makes for a useful edgeguarding tool."
"1840","Mii Brawler","Neutral special","Flashing Mach Punch","0.4% (hits 1-21), 9.5% (hit 22); 17.9% if all hits connect","The Brawler performs five fast punches with a single hand. If any of these punches land, the move will extend into a flurry of consecutive punches, the maximum total being 22. The last hit deals good vertical knockback, KOing at around 115%. If the move lands on an opponent, the Brawler gains invincibility for the duration of the move, making the move hard to interrupt. Although it has respectably fast startup (frame 10), it has noticeable ending lag that makes it easy to punish if whiffed. If the first few hits are shielded, or hit opponents under the effects of armor, it will not transition to the looping portion of the move. The move doesn't lose power if used in the air, and the first use will stall the Brawler's descent. Subsequent uses will have the Brawler fall while punching, which can act as a niche landing option to catch approaching opponents."
"1841","Mii Brawler","Neutral special","Exploding Side Kick","23% (leg), 25% (foot), 26% (reversed, leg), 28% (reversed, foot), 19.5% (aerial, leg), 21.25% (aerial, foot), 22.1% (reversed aerial, leg), 23.75% (reversed aerial, foot)","Stands on one leg and charges their leg in flame, before unleashing a powerful burning kick. Functions like Falcon Punch. The move can be reversed once anytime during the move; the window to do so is extremely lenient compared to other moves of its kind, allowing the Brawler to turn around right before the kick itself. The Brawler gains super armor just before the kick, even if started in midair, allowing it to function as a hard punish. For its power, it has surprisingly low ending lag, which was further reduced in the 2.0.0 patch; the move is safe on shield as a result."
"1842","Mii Brawler","Side special","Onslaught","2% (hit 1), 1.5% (hits 2-7), 5% (hit 8)","Charges forward with their knee out. If the knee connects against an opponent, the Brawler will perform a series of blows (a knee strike, a kick with the opposite leg, a backhanded punch, a swinging fist punch with the opposite arm, a double-hitting axe kick, and a double-fisted axe handle swing) concluded by a backflip kick. If whiffed, there is noticeable endlag. In the air, even after attacking, Onslaught leaves the Brawler helpless. It has excellent KO potential, as it can KO grounded opponents as early as 110%. Onslaught deals increased knockback as the Mii Brawler's damage accumulates, similarly to and separate from the effects of rage, but this multiplier lowers to 1x when the move is successfully used. Onslaught will go back to full power after some time, indicated by a brief flash of purple sparkles on the Brawler's shoes. Despite its in-game description, accumulated damage doesn't affect the damage of the move."
"1843","Mii Brawler","Side special","Burning Dropkick","13%","Extends both legs in front of themself, charging forward to deliver a dropkick while covered with flames. Unlike the previous iteration of this move, it is no longer chargeable, so it deals set damage. Furthermore, it now covers a set, albeit vastly reduced distance, and can now miss entirely if started right next to an opponent. As a result, it has lost majority of its utility from SSB4, though it is still an effective approach move due to its quick startup, and can also KO at high percents."
"1844","Mii Brawler","Side special","Suplex","18%, 3% (collateral grab), 4.5% (collateral descent), 15% (collateral slam)","A command grab in which the Brawler dashes forward a short distance with their arms out in a grabbing motion. If it connects, the Brawler will lift the opponent into the air and do a backwards suplex, slamming the opponent headfirst into the ground. The Brawler gains super armor while throwing an opponent. Any opponents nearby for the grab and slam will take collateral damage. The move has extremely low knockback scaling, but can be used to effectively rack up damage. If used in midair, the move causes helplessness; it can grab foes near an edge and drag them off as a sacrificial KO, though it will always KO the Brawler first. Suplex makes for a poor horizontal recovery option, as it travels less distance than Onslaught."
"1845","Mii Brawler","Up special","Soaring Axe Kick","4% (hit 1), 3% (air hit 2), 6% (ground hit 2), 4% (shockwave)","Performs an upward flip kick. Similar to Cloud's Climhazzard, a second press of the special move button will have the flip kick followed up by an axe kick that meteor smashes opponents in the air. The move will snap to ledges during the rising portion, and can also snap during the downward kick after a bit of travel time. Both hits transition quickly, and the landing hit has enough knockback to KO at around 120% near the edge of Final Destination. The meteor smash is notably powerful, as it can KO ledge hanging opponents at as low as 20%."
"1846","Mii Brawler","Up special","Helicopter Kick","3% (hit 1, ground), 1.5% (hit 1, air), 1.5% (hits 2 - 5), 6% (hit 6)","Performs a flurry of spinning kicks while traveling diagonally upward, similar to Fox's forward aerial. Travels much higher if initiated from the ground. The trajectory of Helicopter Kick's final hit can be altered: holding forward will make its knockback diagonal, while holding back will make its knockback more vertical. This allows the Brawler to choose how to launch the opponent. Allows for long horizontal recovery, but lacks vertical lift. While it is still an excellent combo finisher out of aerials or a throw, its knockback has been heavily reduced from Smash 4, making it unable to KO extremely early near the sides of the stage."
"1847","Mii Brawler","Up special","Thrust Uppercut","0.8% (hits 1-5), 9% (hit 6)","The Brawler rises upwards with a multi-hitting uppercut, at a slight diagonal trajectory. The uppercut is followed by a second uppercut with the opposite fist. By angling during the ascent, it is possible to travel further horizontally, though the move has deceptively low recovery distance due to the move's animation. It has very fast startup (frame 3), and renders the Brawler's arm intangible from frames 3 to 7. Like Helicopter Kick, Thrust Uppercut is a reliable combo finisher due to its speed, though its trajectory is more suitable for ending vertical combos. However, it is much weaker than the previous version (Piston Punch), which was capable of KOing out of a down throw from 65%. As a result, Thrust Uppercut's combos are more suited for damage racking, though it can KO near the top blast line at around 140%."
"1848","Mii Brawler","Down special","Head-On Assault","6% (flip kick), 1% (multi-hits), 14% (landing)","The Brawler leaps up, performing a backflip kick with both of their legs, and plummets downward with a corkscrewing headbutt. If performed in the air, the Brawler will just perform the headbutt. On the ground, the initial leap sends the opponent into the main headbutt. In both versions of the move, the descending headbutt hits multiple times, and acts as a meteor smash. If the grounded version is used as a sacrificial KO, the opponent will be KO'd first. The grounded hit is very powerful and can KO consistently at 120%, though it is extremely risky due to its overall lag. If performed in midair while facing a ledge, the Brawler will be able to sweetspot said ledge, allowing it to be used as an edgeguard. The move does a high amount of shield damage, being able to break full shields if both hits connect."
"1849","Mii Brawler","Down special","Feint Jump","10% (diving kick), 7% (meteor smashing kick)","Flips off the ground and, when the special button is pressed again, performs a divekick while surrounded by a blue aura. The startup offers brief intangibility. Similarly to Zero Suit Samus's Flip Jump, by landing on an opponent midair during the jump, the Brawler will automatically perform a kick which meteor smashes foes. The angle they are launched, however, is more diagonal, similar to that of Ryu's down air. The direction they are sent is opposite of the direction of the flip (i.e flipping to the right will diagonally meteor smash the opponent to the left, and vice versa). Both the jump and the kick can be reversed if the player taps in the other direction upon startup."
"1850","Mii Brawler","Down special","Counter Throw","1.5× (minimum 14%), 9% (collateral hit)","The Brawler enters a defensive stance, bringing their arms close to their face. Upon being hit, the Brawler will counterattack by grabbing the opponent and slamming them on the ground behind themself. The slam will lightly damage nearby opponents. Unlike other counters, Counter Throw has a short duration, but low ending lag, allowing it to be used more flexibly. However, unlike other counters, Counter Throw completely fails against projectiles and attacks that hit their legs (i.e. attacks from underneath the Brawler), and moves with sufficiently disjointed hitboxes will cause the retaliating grab to miss. As a result, the counterattack can be rather inconsistent."
"1851","Mii Brawler","Final Smash","Omega Blitz","56.4%","Knocks the target into the air with an upwards-arching heel kick, and then proceeds to strike them with a maelstrom of punches and kicks before smashing them back downwards with a downward straight punch."
"1852","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral attack","","3%","Performs an inward slash, followed by an outward slash, and concluded with an upwards-arching slash. The first 2 hits can lock."
"1853","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral attack","","3%","Performs an inward slash, followed by an outward slash, and concluded with an upwards-arching slash. The first 2 hits can lock."
"1854","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral attack","","5%","Performs an inward slash, followed by an outward slash, and concluded with an upwards-arching slash. The first 2 hits can lock."
"1855","Mii Swordfighter","Forward tilt","","12%","A horizontal swipe."
"1856","Mii Swordfighter","Up tilt","","7%","Slashes in an arc above their heads. This covers the Swordfighter's entire body."
"1857","Mii Swordfighter","Down tilt","","8%","A low sword thrust along the ground, similar to Marth's down tilt. Has low ending lag, and launches opponents slightly upward. Great for starting combos."
"1858","Mii Swordfighter","Dash attack","","10%","Performs an outward swipe while sliding forward."
"1859","Mii Swordfighter","Forward smash","","14% (hilt), 15% (blade), 16% (tip)","Steps forward and, with both arms, swings their sword downwards and inwards. Deals good knockback and has surprisingly high range, but suffers from high lag on both ends."
"1860","Mii Swordfighter","Up smash","","4% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2), 7% (hit 3)","Jumps and performs two corkscrewing slashes over their head before touching the ground. There is a hitbox in front of the Swordfighter just before the first slash comes out, which will hit opponents in front of the Swordfighter a total of three times. Anyone touching the back of the Swordfighter will only be hit twice."
"1861","Mii Swordfighter","Down smash","","12% (front), 15% (back)","Crouches and slashes low to the ground: first in front, and then behind."
"1862","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral aerial","","8%","Slashes in a circle while doing a corkscrew in the air. A good spacing and approach move that can be used to initiate combos when used close to the ground."
"1863","Mii Swordfighter","Forward aerial","","3% (hits 1 and 2), 5% (hit 3)","Stabs forward three times, each stab at a slightly higher angle than the last. The first two hits trap opponents into the final hit, which deals good knockback. The first two slashes can be used to start ground combos."
"1864","Mii Swordfighter","Back aerial","","14%","Spins to perform an extremely fast backwards slash. One of the Mii Swordfighter's more reliable finishers, especially in the air."
"1865","Mii Swordfighter","Up aerial","","16% (clean), 10% (late)","Points the sword above their head and spins. Very powerful when hitting clean, and the late hit can be used to initiate ground combos."
"1866","Mii Swordfighter","Down aerial","","1.5% (hits 1-5), 5% (hit 6)","Spins while holding their sword beneath themselves, hitting multiple times like a drill. Upon landing, the landing impact will create a shockwave that launches opponents away."
"1867","Mii Swordfighter","Grab","","—","Reaches in front on them with their free hand."
"1868","Mii Swordfighter","Pummel","","1.3%","A knee strike."
"1869","Mii Swordfighter","Forward throw","","3% (kick), 3% (throw)","Front kicks the opponent away."
"1870","Mii Swordfighter","Back throw","","3% (kick), 3% (throw)","Knocks the opponent away with a roundhouse kick."
"1871","Mii Swordfighter","Up throw","","2% (slash), 3% (throw)","Tosses the enemy up and then performs a midair spinning slash to knock them away. Possibly Mii Swordfighter’s worst throw due to dealing low damage and knockback as well as not having low enough end lag to make it a versatile combo starter."
"1872","Mii Swordfighter","Down throw","","2% (slam), 2% (throw)","Slams the opponent on the ground. One of Mii Swordfighter's best throws since it can combo into neutral aerial, forward aerial and up aerial at low to mid percents. Notably, it can confirm a KO into an up aerial at high percents making it a strong kill confirm."
"1873","Mii Swordfighter","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swings the sword around themselves while getting up."
"1874","Mii Swordfighter","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings the sword in a back-to-front circle while getting up."
"1875","Mii Swordfighter","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings the sword front to back before standing back up."
"1876","Mii Swordfighter","Edge attack","","9%","Climbs onto the stage and stabs forward."
"1877","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral special","Gale Strike","13% (clean), 11% (mid), 10% (late)","Creates a small tornado and sends it forwards. The tornado travels half the length of Final Destination, dealing less damage as it travels. The projectile is unique as it deals set knockback, and as such retains the old knockback physics, giving it increased hitstun. This makes it a potent combo initiator, allowing aerial followups at any percent range."
"1878","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral special","Shuriken of Light","2% (close), 3.5% (mid), 5% (mid-far), 6.5% (far)","Throws a bright, translucent shuriken forwards. The shuriken gains more damaging power as it travels, unable to flinch opponents at point-blank range but doing more knockback at maximum range. The distance it covers, coupled with its spammability, makes it useful for camping."
"1879","Mii Swordfighter","Neutral special","Blurring Blade","0.8% (hits 1 - 5, uncharged), 8% (hit 6, uncharged), 1.9% (hits 1 - 5, fully charged), 19.2% (hit 6, fully charged)","The Swordfighter charges their sword, with the blade aflame, briefly before stabbing with the sword forward multiple times and finishing in a high-knockback upwards slash. The move can be reversed just before the attack is initiated."
"1880","Mii Swordfighter","Side special","Airborne Assault","12%","Gets into a charge-like stance, then launches at the enemy, somersaulting with the blade. Travels a set distance in a light arc, allowing then to hit downed and low crouching opponents. If used on any kind of platform, the Swordfighter will stop at the edge. The Swordfighter will perform a high-arc frontflip upon clean contact, or a high backflip if hitting a shield, making approaching safe. If used in midair, there is a period after the move concludes where the Swordfighter will be able to perform an additional action. However, if nothing is done during this period, the Swordfighter will enter the helpless state."
"1881","Mii Swordfighter","Side special","Gale Stab","8% (uncharged), 18.5% (fully charged)","The Swordfighter rushes forward, holding out their sword to stab. This move can be charged."
"1882","Mii Swordfighter","Side special","Chakram","1.1% (per hit, slow chakram), 8% (fast chakram)","Throws a chakram as a projectile that can be angled and sent upwards, downwards, or straight forward. If inputted like a smash attack, it will fly faster with increased range and damage. Otherwise, it will fly in front of the Mii Swordfighter and slowly return towards the position from which it was thrown (much like a boomerang), hitting multiple times. The chakram can be lodged into the floor and walls, but cannot be picked up. This move is good for walling out approaches and initiating combos, and also for ledge trapping and edgeguarding. However, unlike other boomerangs in the game, it cannot travel through platforms and doesn't bounce, instead lodging itself in the ground and losing all momentum."
"1883","Mii Swordfighter","Up special","Stone Scabbard","4% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2), 5% (hit 3), 3% (through platforms)","Slashes upwards while jumping and then stabs downwards while falling. The second hit is a powerful meteor smash. The landing hit forces the Mii's sword through thin platforms, which damages opponents underneath. The Mii Swordfighter will not stop until it hits ground as soon as the second portion of the attack begins, making it easy to self-destruct off-stage with the move if not aimed carefully."
"1884","Mii Swordfighter","Up special","Skyward Slash Dash","2.2% (hit 1), 3% (hits 2 - 6), 4% (hit 7)","After a brief charge, the Mii performs a series of sword strikes while dashing in a straight line, which can be aimed in any direction using the control stick."

If used in the air, the Mii will rise, doing multiple hits. The ground variant can be charged to deal even more damage. Functions much like the Spin Attack, but with poorer vertical recovery in exchange for extremely high knockback on the final strike when used in the air, able to KO middleweights from as low as 50% when initiated from the edge and drifting outwards for the duration of the attack."
"1886","Mii Swordfighter","Down special","Blade Counter","1.5× (minimum 8%)","The Swordfighter holds their sword in a reverse grip behind them. If hit, the Swordfighter retaliates with an upward slash, knocking opponents upward. This move has low endlag, and can be used to initiate combos at low percents (provided the countered move doesn't launch the opponent too high)."
"1887","Mii Swordfighter","Down special","Reversal Slash","6% (slash); 1.8× (reflection)","The Swordfighter performs a slash, leaving an S-shaped rainbow-colored swirl. The slash reflects projectiles and flips nearby opponents, similar to Mario's Cape."

When used in the air, the Swordfighter launches at a downwards diagonal direction. The tip of the sword deals more damage."
"1889","Mii Swordfighter","Final Smash","Final Edge","1.7% (shockwave, close), 2.4% (shockwave, mid), 3% (shockwave, far)","The Swordfighter gets into a stance, and then proceeds to perform a series of rapid slashes, releasing multicolored shockwaves. The shockwaves deal more damage as they reach their maximum distance. The range of the Final Smash covers all of Final Destination if used at the edge."
"1890","Mii Gunner","Neutral attack","","1.7%","A jab with their left hand, followed by a spin kick, and an explosion from their arm cannon. Holding the attack button will have the Gunner repeat the jab. The first two hits can lock floored opponents. The third hit consists of two hits, one from the cannon and one from the explosion; both hits easily lead into each other, unlike the version in Smash 4."
"1891","Mii Gunner","Neutral attack","","1.7%","A jab with their left hand, followed by a spin kick, and an explosion from their arm cannon. Holding the attack button will have the Gunner repeat the jab. The first two hits can lock floored opponents.

"1892","Mii Gunner","Neutral attack","","1% (cannon), 4.5% (explosion)","A jab with their left hand, followed by a spin kick, and an explosion from their arm cannon. Holding the attack button will have the Gunner repeat the jab. The first two hits can lock floored opponents. The third hit consists of two hits, one from the cannon and one from the explosion; both hits easily lead into each other, unlike the version in Smash 4."
"1893","Mii Gunner","Forward tilt","","13%(close), 10.5% (middle), 8% (far)","Fires a short range energy burst. The burst deals more damage up close. The Mii Gunner's fastest ground move, and is much faster in comparison to the version in Smash 4. However, it is also weak, as it KOs Mario on the edge of Final Destination at around 143%. As such, it is more effective as a spacing or ""get-off-me"" option."
"1894","Mii Gunner","Up tilt","","10% (clean), 8% (late)","Uppercuts with their arm cannon, releasing a discharge of flames. A damaging move with very fast startup (frame 5) but very high ending lag, giving it no followups. Its vertical range covers space right above the Mii Gunner's head and half a character length beside her, making it an effective anti-air attack. The clean hit KOs Mario on Final Destination at 139%."
"1895","Mii Gunner","Down tilt","","14%","Fires a burst of flame onto the ground in front of themself, similarly to Samus's down tilt. Like up tilt, it is fast for its damage (frame 8) and is the Gunner's most damaging tilt, but has such high ending lag that it has no followups. As a result, it is mostly used to punish grounded openings, in comparison to the anti-air strengths of up tilt. Despite its higher damage, it KOs slightly later than up tilt, doing so only at 141%."
"1896","Mii Gunner","Dash attack","","11%","Performs a swinging punch with the arm cannon, blasting the enemy with flames. Grants a lot of forward momentum overall, allowing it to punish distant foes. Starts on frame 10 and has good knockback, KOing Mario from the edge of Final Destination at 115%, but it has punishable ending lag."
"1897","Mii Gunner","Forward smash","","1.7% (hits 1 - 6), 7.5% (hit 7)","Unleashes a series of energy bursts in quick succession, followed by a stronger burst. Hits opponents 7 times and has tremendous range, being one of the longest forward smashes in the game (surpassed only by the Belmonts and Corrin). Coupled with its very long hitbox duration, it is overall difficult to challenge, pressures shields well, and is useful for edgeguarding. It is safe on shield at max distance due to its decently low ending lag. For its strengths, it also has reliable KO potential, KOing at center-stage from 122%. However, it is the Gunner's slowest smash attack (frame 17)."
"1898","Mii Gunner","Up smash","","3% (hit 1), 2.5% (hits 2 - 4), 7% (hit 5)","Releases five bursts of fire in an arc above her head, similarly to Samus's up smash. Starts on frame 11 and deals good damage. Due to the Gunner's height, it is more consistent with hitting grounded opponents compared to Samus's up smash. Like in Smash 4, opponents may fall out of the looping hits if they are at an extremely high percent, are hit by the sides of the explosion's hitboxes, or while they are standing on a platform above the Gunner. KOs Mario on Final Destination at 122%."
"1899","Mii Gunner","Down smash","","11.5% (front), 14% (behind)","Fires two bursts of flame onto the ground, first in front then behind of themself. Each flame burst launches opponents away, though the second one has significantly more knockback than the first. The first hit starts on frame 9, making it the Gunner's fastest smash attack. Both hits have deceptively high range, especially the second hit. The second hit uses the combined damage of the Gunner's previous down smash, which connected into each other; as a result, it has very high KO power, KOing Mario from the edge of Final Destination at 66%."
"1900","Mii Gunner","Neutral aerial","","10%","Sweeps their arm cannon downward in an arc around themself similar to Ike’s. It is the Gunner's fastest aerial (frame 8), and has a high amount of active frames alongside good coverage. At low percents (especially against super heavyweight characters), a neutral aerial on grounded opponents can lead to a neutral combo, forward tilt, dash attack, forward smash, and up smash. However, its high base knockback makes followups almost impossible at mid-percents unless it is a projectile. As a result, it is mostly an aerial ""get-off-me"" option, and is useful for landing since it has 11 frames of landing lag."
"1901","Mii Gunner","Forward aerial","","8% (close), 6% (far)","Fires a single weak energy shot projectile; the force of the shot pushes the Mii Gunner backward. The recoil of the forward aerial can be used by the Mii Gunner to do a gundash to aid in recovery or for evasion (tilting the stick backwards while shifting back from recoil allows Mii Gunner to effectively keep distance from opponents more than air dodging). Though its range was shortened from Smash 4 (it now travels 1/4 of Final Destination instead of 1/3), it has reduced ending lag, which makes it better for performing combos. If used while close to the ground (the energy projectile hitting the opponent just before the Gunner lands), the Gunner will be able to act almost immediately upon landing."
"1902","Mii Gunner","Back aerial","","13% (early), 11% (late)","Releases a burst of flames from the arm cannon behind themself. The Gunner's most reliable aerial finisher, able to KO middleweights from centerstage at around 130%. It is also the Gunner's second fastest aerial (frame 9), though it will miss short characters if performed out of a short hop."
"1903","Mii Gunner","Up aerial","","1.7% (hits 1 - 6), 4% (hit 7)","Unleashes a series of energy bursts upwards in quick succession, followed by a stronger burst. Acts like the Gunner's forward smash aimed vertically upwards. Unlike in Smash 4, it now deals less hits but more damage, and can complete in a short hop, making it less awkward to use. However, the attack still cuts off abruptly if the Gunner lands before the final shot is used. A good juggling tool and KO move if the final hit connects at height, and can limit the aerial options of opponents or force them to air dodge. Up aerial's looping hits can also combo into other moves when landing, such as into up tilt as a KO combo."
"1904","Mii Gunner","Down aerial","","10% (cannon), 15% (burst), 12% (late)","The Gunner pauses, then fires a single burst of flame below themself. The burst itself deals more damage and is a very strong, aerial-only meteor smash. However, the meteor hitbox only lasts for one frame, and turns into a weaker non-meteor smashing hitbox one frame later. As a result, it is difficult to land."
"1905","Mii Gunner","Grab","","—","The Gunner reaches in front of themself with their left hand."
"1906","Mii Gunner","Pummel","","1.2%","A knee strike."
"1907","Mii Gunner","Forward throw","","4% (punch), 3% (throw)","Punches the enemy away with the arm cannon."
"1908","Mii Gunner","Back throw","","7% (throw), 3% (energy pellet)","Tosses the opponent behind themself, then fires a single energy pellet at the foe. It can KO at extremely high percentages, but the laser can be avoided with DI."
"1909","Mii Gunner","Up throw","","7% (throw), 3% (both energy pellets)","Tosses the enemy above themselves, then fires 2 energy pellets at the foe. The Gunner's most damaging throw, dealing 13%; it is the second most damaging up throw if both hits connect, surpassed only by King K. Rool. It is thus useful for racking up damage and refreshing the staleness of the Gunner's other moves."
"1910","Mii Gunner","Down throw","","7%","Slams the enemy onto the ground, launching them upward. Can start combos into aerials till mid percents, though it quickly loses effectiveness. Unlike in SSB4, down throw is no longer completely identical in function to Marth's equivalent move."
"1911","Mii Gunner","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Thr Gunner quickly fires a flame burst on either side as they stand up."
"1912","Mii Gunner","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Similar to their frontal floor attack."
"1913","Mii Gunner","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Shoots a blast of fire in front then behind themself."
"1914","Mii Gunner","Edge attack","","9%","Swings their arm cannon ahead."
"1915","Mii Gunner","Neutral special","Charge Blast","4% (uncharged), 26% (fully charged)","Charges and fires a large energy sphere. The Mii Gunner can charge the blast in midair, and charge cancel by jumping or using an air dodge. Pressing any attack button while charging will fire the sphere. It is the Gunner's strongest projectile special move, with a fully-charged shot being capable of KOing from center-stage at 105%. Uncharged versions can lock floored opponents."
"1916","Mii Gunner","Neutral special","Laser Blaze","5%","Fires spammable green energy pellets that cause flinching. Similar to Falco's Blaster, but fires at a slightly slower rate while inflicting slightly more damage. It does not lose strength while traveling, making it a useful damage racker. The lasers can also lock floored opponents."
"1917","Mii Gunner","Neutral special","Grenade Launch","1.3% (hits 1 -5), 6.5% (hit 6)","After a pause, the Mii Gunner fires a grenade from their arm cannon. The grenade travels in an arc and will weakly bounce once on the ground, traveling almost half the distance of Final Destination. The grenade will explode around one second after launch, or detonate on impact with enemies, dealing multiple hits with a final launching hit. The grenade does a lot of damage if it all hits connect (12.2%) and can KO at around 138%. The Mii Gunner can maneuver in the air while preparing to fire the grenade. It is overall a useful move for covering and limiting movement options, or edgeguarding recovering opponents; coupled with its low ending lag, it can start low percent combos or constantly deter approaches."
"1918","Mii Gunner","Side special","Flame Pillar","2% (hit 1), 2.2% (hits 2 - 5), 2.7% (hit 6)","Fires an energy shot diagonally down that erupts into a pillar of flame that lingers for a few moments. The pillar, similar to Robin's Arcfire, hits multiple times, with the last hit launching opponents away. If used in midair, the projectile's angle is more diagonal and travels further. The pillar will slowly drift downwards if it hits an aerial opponent, allowing it to function as an edgeguard if it hits an enemy near a ledge. It is otherwise a useful deterring tool, and can start combos from careless approaches. Can confirm into a charge blast reliably KOing opponents at 80 percent on the ledge."
"1919","Mii Gunner","Side special","Stealth Burst","12.1 - 18%","Fires a small shining energy shot that detonates when the button is released, similarly to Zelda's Din's Fire but only traveling straight. As the name suggests, Stealth Burst is very hard to telegraph due to how small its particle effect is, making it useful for mindgames and edgeguarding. Holding the button gives the shot more distance and power before detonating. Using it in the air will slow the Gunner's fall speed momentarily. All charge levels have KO potential, with no-charge/fully-charged Stealth Bursts KOing at around 133%/110%. However, its hitbox is rather small, especially if uncharged."
"1920","Mii Gunner","Side special","Gunner Missile","7.5% (homing missile), 14.5% (super missile)","Functions like Samus's Missile: holding the button will fire a homing missile, and inputting like a smash attack fires a super missile. Each missile travels a different distance, with the homing variant traveling more than half of Final Destination, and the super variant traveling almost the stage's full length. The homing missiles have decent homing capabilities, while the super missiles speed up after an initial pause and have good KO potential, able to KO Mario at the edge of Final Destination from 120%. The super missile can combo into Charge Blast if both are fired one after another against an opponent at medium distance. Homing missles can lock floored opponents."
"1921","Mii Gunner","Up special","Lunar Launch","7%","The Gunner fires a flaming projectile beneath themself, launching into the air from the recoil. Grants excellent vertical height but passable horizontal momentum. The projectile itself explodes on contact with solid ground and other opponents, and launches foes in the opposite direction from where the Gunner is facing. The projectile is able to KO at the edge of Final Destination from 130%."
"1922","Mii Gunner","Up special","Cannon Jump Kick","9% (concussive blast), 8% (kick), 6% (late)","Fires a concussive blast, then propels themselves with the arm cannon while kicking into the air. A sweetspotted concussive blast can meteor smash midair opponents. The kick itself is extremely powerful and the clean hit lasts for most of the move; coupled with it starting on frame 6 and granting intangibility on the same frame, it is an excellent out of shield option. KOs as early as 115% onstage. However, it is extremely ineffective for recovery, as it covers the lowest vertical distance out of all the Mii Gunner's up specials."
"1923","Mii Gunner","Up special","Arm Rocket","0%","Propels themself with a stream of flames from their arm cannon. By holding the Control Stick in a direction, the Mii Gunner can travel more horizontally. During flight, tilting left or right will adjust the Mii's flight angle. Overall, the move acts like an unchargeable version of Rocketbarrel Boost but without any damaging hitboxes, and grants the most distance and maneuverability out of all the Gunner's up specials."
"1924","Mii Gunner","Down special","Echo Reflector","2% (activation), 1.5× damage (reflected projectiles)","Activates an energy shield composed of two yellow hexagons that rotate around the Mii Gunner. Reflects projectiles at 1.5x their original strength. Despite its appearance, projectiles from above will also be reflected. It is similar to Fox's Reflector, however the hitbox at the beginning deals less knockback, and it does not provide brief intangibility, but in return the reflected projectiles deal an extra 0.1x damage."
"1925","Mii Gunner","Down special","Bomb Drop","2% (bomb), 9% (explosion)","Drops a small bomb that bounces off the ground and explodes either upon contact with an enemy, or after a set time (134 frames, or roughly 1.6 seconds).Inputting the move again causes the bomb to automatically detonate while dropping another bomb, making it difficult for opponents to approach the Gunner. It is overall a useful stage control move, as it can block opposing projectiles, trap opponents at ledges, and can even KO at around 170%. However, opponents can knock the bomb away with their own attacks, and the bomb will harm the Mii Gunner while it is knocked around."
"1926","Mii Gunner","Down special","Absorbing Vortex","4%","Covers themself with a glowing energy shield that absorbs energy projectiles and converts its damage to healing, similarly to Ness's PSI Magnet. However, unlike Ness, Absorbing Vortex does not have multiple hits, instead only having a single hit upon start-up (7 frames).  Heals 1.4x the damage the Gunner would have taken. Upon activation, as well as when absorbing projectiles, any nearby opponents will take slight damage. This hitbox is capable of locking. However, the minimal histun of this move invalidates the combo potential. Additionally, absorbing vortex reduces falling speed, allowing Gunner to Stall in mid air, allowing its use as a potential landing mixup."
"1927","Mii Gunner","Final Smash","Full Blast","67.1% (maximum damage)","The Gunner shoots a strong laser, with two small laser cannons firing smaller lasers that circle the main laser. Can be angled during the move. The middle of the laser does slightly more damage than the beginning. The Final Smash also does more damage if angled (as the opponent will be hit by both the big and small lasers)."
"1928","Daisy","Neutral attack","","2%","Slaps the enemy twice with her leading arm: the first being an inward forehand slap, and the second being an outward backhand slap. At low percentages, the first hit can lock."
"1929","Daisy","Neutral attack","","3%","Slaps the enemy twice with her leading arm: the first being an inward forehand slap, and the second being an outward backhand slap. At low percentages, the first hit can lock."
"1930","Daisy","Forward tilt","","7% (early, clean leg), 8% (clean foot)","Kicks forward 180 degrees from low to high. Has good range for a forward tilt, and unusually for an attack of its type, launches opponents vertically, allowing it to perform air combos."
"1931","Daisy","Up tilt","","10% (blast), 8% (arm)","Extends her arm upward, creating a discharge of orange magic in the form of a flower."
"1932","Daisy","Down tilt","","7%","A low sweep kick. This move meteor smashes grounded opponents. Decently strong attack with moderate startup that can follow up into a forward smash at lower percents, forward or up aerials at mid-percents, and into an up special at higher percents."
"1933","Daisy","Dash attack","","4% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Creating magical sparks in her hands, Daisy strikes with both arms extended forward, then quickly spreads her arms out."
"1934","Daisy","Forward smash","","18% (frying pan)","Strikes with a bludgeon, depending on the angle of the smash attack: angling upward uses a frying pan, angling downward uses the tennis racket, and no angling uses the golf club. Each weapon has different properties—the frying pan has more vertical knockback (and the most damage), the golf club has more diagonal knockback (and the most range), and the tennis racket has more horizontal knockback and is a strong semi-spike."
"1935","Daisy","Forward smash","","15% (golf club)","Strikes with a bludgeon, depending on the angle of the smash attack: angling upward uses a frying pan, angling downward uses the tennis racket, and no angling uses the golf club. Each weapon has different properties—the frying pan has more vertical knockback (and the most damage), the golf club has more diagonal knockback (and the most range), and the tennis racket has more horizontal knockback and is a strong semi-spike."
"1936","Daisy","Forward smash","","13.5% (tennis racket)","Strikes with a bludgeon, depending on the angle of the smash attack: angling upward uses a frying pan, angling downward uses the tennis racket, and no angling uses the golf club. Each weapon has different properties—the frying pan has more vertical knockback (and the most damage), the golf club has more diagonal knockback (and the most range), and the tennis racket has more horizontal knockback and is a strong semi-spike."
"1937","Daisy","Up smash","Ribbon Dance","12% (ribbon), 17% (flower)","Raises her arm and twirls an orange ribbon. A flower appears at the tip of the ribbon, which is where the sweetspot is located. Her head and arm become intangible for the duration of the move (frames 14-20)."
"1938","Daisy","Down smash","","2% (hits 1-6), 3% (hit 7)","Daisy does a counterclockwise spin on her left leg and utilizes the edge of her dress, slashing multiple times."
"1939","Daisy","Neutral aerial","","13% (clean), 6% (late arms), 5% (late body)","Spins around at an angle with arms extended, dealing damage to her left and right sides. The late hit can lock."
"1940","Daisy","Forward aerial","","15% (crown), 14% (arm)","Daisy grabs the crown off her head and strikes with it in a vertical arc with magic sparkles. Has the slowest startup out of all her aerial attacks. However, it is also her strongest aerial, if sweetspotted. Her arm possesses a sourspot that deals 1% less damage, and KOs much later."
"1941","Daisy","Back aerial","","12% (clean), 10.2% (mid), 7% (late)","Daisy strikes behind her by thrusting her rear. She creates a flower, although it is aesthetic and possesses no hitbox. At low percent, even hitting clean, can lock."
"1942","Daisy","Up aerial","","4% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","Swipes above her head with her arms from left to right, creating 2 magic rainbow trails. When low floating, only the second hit will hit medium to large opponents, while small characters avoid it entirely."
"1943","Daisy","Down aerial","","2% (hits 1-3), 5% (hit 4)","Rapidly kicks straight downwards four times. Depending on how the last hit lands, may launch opponents behind her. From a short hop, it can even combo into another down aerial after her double jump."
"1944","Daisy","Grab","","—","Reaches out with her arm."
"1945","Daisy","Pummel","","1.3%","The Toad punches the opponent."
"1946","Daisy","Forward throw","","2% (hit 1), 8% (throw)","The Toad leaps forward, headbutting the opponent away."
"1947","Daisy","Back throw","","2% (hit 1), 9% (throw)","Places opponent behind her and bumps them away with her rear. The Toad is present, mimicking her rear thrust, but does not contribute any damage. The strongest of Daisy's throws."
"1948","Daisy","Up throw","","2% (hit 1), 6% (throw)","Puts opponent above her, and strikes them upward. The Toad leaps up with Daisy, but does not hit the opponent."
"1949","Daisy","Down throw","","1% (hit 1), 7% (throw)","After putting the opponent on the ground, the Toad leaps up and headbutts them, sending them upwards and behind Daisy. Good for starting combos, as it can lead to her back air and forward tilt at low to mid percents."
"1950","Daisy","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swirls around in a similar fashion to Mario's down smash."
"1951","Daisy","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings her legs around."
"1952","Daisy","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Two kicks to either side."
"1953","Daisy","Edge attack","","9%","While getting up, swipes forward with a hand at ground level."
"1954","Daisy","Neutral special","Toad","3.5% (per hit)","Daisy covers her ears and turns away as a Toad appears in front of her, arms spread out. If hit, the Toad will retaliate with a spray of spores, and Daisy will wince. If attacked from behind, Daisy and the Toad switch places. Direction can be switched manually, but it has strict timing."
"1955","Daisy","Side special","Daisy Bomber","12%","Daisy lunges her body forward to deliver a powerful bash with her rear. Upon impact, she rebounds away from the victim, allowing for hit-and-run tactics. Deals considerable shield damage. Smash-inputting the move has her travel further."
"1956","Daisy","Up special","Daisy Parasol","3% (first hit), 1% (hits 2-5), 2% (last hit), 2% (open)","Daisy jumps upward and then opens a parasol similar to Peach's, jabbing those above her in the process. It can then be used as a directional glide but can also be opened or closed at will."
"1957","Daisy","Down special","Vegetable","Varies","Plucks a Vegetable from Super Mario Bros. 2 from the ground. She can then throw it as a projectile item. Its face determines how much damage it will do; the rarer the expression, the stronger the turnip. Along with turnips, Daisy can rarely pull out Mr. Saturns and Bob-ombs."
"1958","Daisy","Final Smash","Daisy Blossom","30% (close), 20% (mid), 10% (far)","Daisy performs a dance, causing all of her enemies to fall asleep. The closer they are to her when she activates it, the more damage they will take and the longer they will slumber. Three giant flowers appear, healing 20%. This Final Smash fails to affect anyone outside the range of the screen borders."
"1959","Piranha Plant","Neutral attack","","2.4%","A leaf jab, followed by a swipe with the opposite leaf, followed by a headbutt, which can be hard to punish on shield due to its low endlag. Alternatively, the leaf swipes can be followed by a flurry of bites, ending in a more powerful bite; similar to Corrin's rapid jab. The flurry can deal up to ~20% in one go, making it good for racking damage. Holding the attack button will have Piranha Plant perform the first jab repeatedly."
"1960","Piranha Plant","Neutral attack","","2.2%","A leaf jab, followed by a swipe with the opposite leaf, followed by a headbutt, which can be hard to punish on shield due to its low endlag. Alternatively, the leaf swipes can be followed by a flurry of bites, ending in a more powerful bite; similar to Corrin's rapid jab. The flurry can deal up to ~20% in one go, making it good for racking damage. Holding the attack button will have Piranha Plant perform the first jab repeatedly."
"1961","Piranha Plant","Neutral attack","","4.4%","A leaf jab, followed by a swipe with the opposite leaf, followed by a headbutt, which can be hard to punish on shield due to its low endlag. Alternatively, the leaf swipes can be followed by a flurry of bites, ending in a more powerful bite; similar to Corrin's rapid jab. The flurry can deal up to ~20% in one go, making it good for racking damage. Holding the attack button will have Piranha Plant perform the first jab repeatedly."
"1962","Piranha Plant","Neutral attack","","0.6% (loop), 3.4% (end)","A leaf jab, followed by a swipe with the opposite leaf, followed by a headbutt, which can be hard to punish on shield due to its low endlag. Alternatively, the leaf swipes can be followed by a flurry of bites, ending in a more powerful bite; similar to Corrin's rapid jab. The flurry can deal up to ~20% in one go, making it good for racking damage. Holding the attack button will have Piranha Plant perform the first jab repeatedly."
"1963","Piranha Plant","Forward tilt","Push and Pull","5.5%","Two forward bites. Pressing the attack button a second time will have the Piranha Plant perform its following bite. It is Piranha Plant's fastest and most damaging tilt, and possesses the longest horizontal range out of all its tilts. Piranha Plant's jaws on the first hit are intangible for as long as the hitboxes are out. It can KO middleweights from the edge of Final Destination at around 144%. Resembles the attacks Piranha Plants make in Super Mario 64."
"1964","Piranha Plant","Forward tilt","Push and Pull","6%","Two forward bites. Pressing the attack button a second time will have the Piranha Plant perform its following bite. It is Piranha Plant's fastest and most damaging tilt, and possesses the longest horizontal range out of all its tilts. Piranha Plant's jaws on the first hit are intangible for as long as the hitboxes are out. It can KO middleweights from the edge of Final Destination at around 144%. Resembles the attacks Piranha Plants make in Super Mario 64."
"1965","Piranha Plant","Up tilt","","9% (head), 7% (body)","Piranha Plant flails its head upward. Its head is intangible for as long as the hitboxes are out. Due to its poor horizontal range and good vertical range, it works best as an anti-air tool, and can KO middleweights at around 147%. At low percents, it is unsafe on hit, but can combo into itself and aerials at slightly higher percents."
"1966","Piranha Plant","Down tilt","","6% (base), 7% (tip)","A swipe with its leaf. Piranha Plant's slowest tilt, but it has great combo potential into an instant dash attack at low percents, and can lead into a neutral aerial or forward aerial up to middling percents."
"1967","Piranha Plant","Dash attack","","10% (clean), 7% (late)","Performs a ""dropkick"" using its pot/pipe. Usually used to tech-chase opponents, or punish from farther distances when Ptooie is too slow. Despite the animation, it struggles to kill even at very high percent."
"1968","Piranha Plant","Forward smash","Prickly Swing","19% (head), 15% (stem)","The Piranha Plant turns into a Prickly Piranha Plant from Super Mario Galaxy and headbutts forward. Its head is intangible for as long as the hitboxes are out. Has a sweetspot on its head. While its startup is rather slow, it is respectively powerful, with the sweetspot KOing middleweights at the edge of Final Destination at around 65%, while the sourspot can KO at around 84%."
"1969","Piranha Plant","Up smash","","3% (hit 1), 12% (hit 2)","The Piranha Plant lunges upward and bites. Like its up tilt and forward smash, its head is intangible for as long as the hitboxes are out, and thanks to its seven active frames, up smash works as a potent anti-air. Due to its multi hit, though, opponents can occasionally fall out of up smash, making it somewhat unreliable at times. It can KO middleweights at around 91%."
"1970","Piranha Plant","Down smash","","12% (front), 14% (back)","The Piranha Plant sweeps its pot/pipe in front, and then behind itself. Both the front and back hits can KO middleweights from the edge of Final Destination at around 95% and 82% respectively. Due to it being Piranha Plant's fastest smash attack and launching at a strong semi-spike angle, it makes it a versatile edgeguarding move, however the hitbox is deceptively smaller than the animation entails, as it doesn't even fully cover the pot/pipe on both hits."
"1971","Piranha Plant","Neutral aerial","","2% (hits 1-4), 3% (hit 5)","The Piranha Plant spins rapidly with its leaves extended, hitting multiple times. Resembles Ivysaur's neutral aerial. Due to its looping hits using an auto-link angle, it can be used to drag opponents down to start grounded combos."
"1972","Piranha Plant","Forward aerial","","11% (pot), 9% (body)","The Piranha Plant swings its pot/pipe upwards in front of itself. A useful edgeguarding tool, as it has wide range and respectable damage and knockback when sweetspotted. Its main drawbacks however come from its high landing lag and auto-cancel window, making it quite unsafe to use often."
"1973","Piranha Plant","Back aerial","Fire Breath","14.5%","The Piranha Plant turns around and spits out a burst of fire. Its slowest aerial, but it is also its strongest, KOing middleweights at around 86% from the edge of Final Destination. It has a high amount of end lag, making it potentially risky to use to stage spike. Fire Piranha Plants originated in Super Mario Bros. 3."
"1974","Piranha Plant","Up aerial","","8%","An upwards headbutt. It is Piranha Plant's fastest aerial, and the only one that can autocancel in a short hop, which makes it a decent juggler with the assistance of platforms. However, due to the move having only 3 active frames and a small hitbox that only exists on its head, it can often whiff due to the deceptive animation."
"1975","Piranha Plant","Down aerial","Flowerpot Meteor","11% (clean), 9% (late)","The Piranha Plant flips then stomps below itself with its pot/pipe. Sweetspots at the bottom of the pot, which will meteor smash rather powerfully. Has very fast startup compared to most meteor smashes, coming out on frame 9, although the sourspot is prioritized over the meteor hitbox, making it difficult to land."
"1976","Piranha Plant","Grab","","—","The Piranha Plant reaches out with its leaves. Among the fastest grabs in the game, but has short range."
"1977","Piranha Plant","Pummel","","1.3%","Bites the opponent."
"1978","Piranha Plant","Forward throw","","3% (hit), 8% (throw)","Headbutts the opponent away. Generally only used for stage control purposes or setting up an edgeguard."

"1986","Piranha Plant","Neutral special","Ptooie","14% (held), 18% (thrown, early), 13% (thrown, late)","The Piranha Plant spits up a metal spiky ball, keeping it suspended by blowing air upwards. The spiky ball can then be blown either in front or behind the Piranha Plant. The spiky ball has transcendent priority (although a strong enough hit can cause it to bounce off), and the move stalls Piranha Plant's descent if used in the air, making it a deadly edgeguarding tool. It is also capable of punishing opponents that attack Piranha Plant out of the move, as the ball will likely drop on their heads and act as a punish. If the ball is blown at its highest, it will be thrown less distance, while it'll be thrown significantly farther when it is at its lowest.

If all hits connect, it will deal a great amount of damage. The cloud itself has no knockback and deals no hitstun, but it can be countered/reflected and shielded. If an opponent attempts to shield against this attack, it will do detrimental damage to the shield itself. The move is chargeable, and it can be saved for later use. During execution, Piranha Plant changes its color to match the Putrid Piranha enemy from the Paper Mario series."
"1988","Piranha Plant","Up special","Piranhacopter","1.2% (hits 1-8), 4% (hit 9)","The Piranha Plant spins its leaves in a fashion akin to a propeller, causing it to rise upward. It can be angled to the left and right during the ascent. Covers excellent distance, being able to successfully recover from near the bottom blast zone. Its looping hits can potentially drag opponents to a blast zone for early KOs, however this is unlikely due to the final hit activating surprisingly early, and its weak knockback scaling. Furthermore, the move's looping hits have SDI multipliers of 3 and 3.5, albeit with only a small window to make inputs. It does have a notably weakness in lacking a hitbox above it, causing its large head to be able to be hit easily. Based on the Jumping Piranha Plants from Super Mario World."
"1989","Piranha Plant","Down special","Long-Stem Strike","8.4% (uncharged, close), 12% (uncharged, far), 18.2% (fully charged, close), 26% (fully charged, far)","The Piranha Plant retreats into its pot/pipe, and extends outward to bite opponents in the direction aimed. This also extends the character’s hurtbox. Piranha Plant can move its pot to aim in one direction while charging, though it is not possible to switch directions after doing so. Piranha Plant gains damage-based heavy armor (tanks up to 15%) and decreases damage slightly during the charge, and intangibility on its head during the bite. A deadly edgeguarding tool due to its aforementioned absurdly high reach and power, notably when fully charged. Its hitbox is also large enough to hit ledge hanging opponents, and also deals high shield damage, depleting more than half a shield at full charge. However, the full extension significantly extends Piranha Plant's hurtbox, making it possible to hit it from afar when timed correctly. Likely a reference to Elasto-Piranhas or Stalking Piranha Plants."

Opponents that get too close will get trapped in his cages. When the Final Smash is nearly over, Petey Piranha will breathe fire at both of the cages, then slam both of the cages to the ground, dealing heavy damage and knockback to the opponents who were trapped in the cages as well as anyone too close when he slams them. It is possible for Petey Piranha to fall off stage, taking any trapped opponents with him, though is not a guaranteed KO if the opponent has leftover jumps, a strong recovery or both. He also doesn't move much from his starting position, making him easy to avoid if the stage is big enough."

"1994","King K. Rool","Forward tilt","","13% (sweetspot), 11% (sourspot)","Rears back and performs a forceful clap, similar to his archnemesis Donkey Kong's forward smash. Gains Belly Super Armor when he rears back to clap, making it a highly effective approach option with pivot cancelling. Sends at a semi-spike angle and is decently fast for its power (comes out on frame 12), KOing at 107% at the edge of Final Destination. It can be angled up and down, making it a decent anti-air tool when angled up, and it is capable of hitting the ledge when angled down. This move is also extremely disjointed, with the hands as a whole being said disjoint, giving it impressive range. It does suffer from moderately high ending lag, though this flaw can be partially mitigated when spaced correctly. The combination of it's range, Belly Super Armor, KO potential and ability to angle it up or down makes it not only one of the best moves in King K. Rool's kit, but also arguably one of the best forward tilts in the game."
"1995","King K. Rool","Up tilt","","11.5% (early), 8.1% (middle), 6.8% (late)","An uppercut. Has a wide hitbox, covering the front of K. Rool, and starts low enough to reach prone enemies. Almost as fast as his neutral attack, coming out at frame 5, which is very fast for a move with reasonably decent KO power. Loses power the longer it is out, with the sweetspot dealing rather strong diagonal knockback, and the sourspot dealing weak, mostly vertical knockback, which can potentially lead to another up tilt or up air. This move works well out of down throw due to it's combination of speed and power."
"1996","King K. Rool","Down tilt","","8% (bury), 13% (non-burying), 10% (non-burying, late), 7% (quake)","A delayed sumo-esque stomp. K. Rool's foot buries grounded opponents, though it cannot do damage to an already-buried enemy. Much stronger on aerial opponents, and can KO at 104% at the edge of Final Destination. The stomp causes a shockwave near his foot. This deals weak vertical knockback to nearby opponents and allowing for moves like forward aerial to be used out of it. Starts with the non-bury hitbox on Frame 13, before the bury comes out at Frame 14. Forward smash is true out of this from around 70%, and kills a lot of the time as well. The hitboxes can hit some opponents below low platforms (such as the left and right platforms on Battlefield). Due to how buries work in Ultimate, it is possible to ""store"" knockback on a buried opponent using a weak attack, forcing them to get unburied over time and sent at the angle of the weak attack; this can create long combo strings at low percents."
"1997","King K. Rool","Dash attack","","15%, 11% (late)","A belly-first lunge based on an attack from Donkey Kong Land. It covers a good distance and has incredible start-up (comes out on frame 7) for its power, but has very high ending lag. It also deals much less damage later into the attack. Has Belly Super Armor and can KO, allowing it to tank opposing hits (especially projectiles) as a risky approach. KOs at 102% at the edge of Final Destination, making it a very good move to use out of down throw through Instant Dash Attack, as it kills larger characters earlier than forward tilt."

"2001","King K. Rool","Up smash","","15% (headbutt), 8% (late headbutt), 10% (plank); 3% (meteor smash)","A quick upward headbutt followed by a comical plank. The headbutt has a small hitbox, but has fast start-up (frame 6) and can KO from medium to high percents. It also has a slightly later hitbox on Frame 10 that deals slightly less damage, making it somewhat inconsistent at times. The initial headbutt can be used to hit opponents above the platforms, or as a risky anti-air move. It is King K. Rool's fastest out of shield option, though it is too situational and risky to be very effective for this purpose. It is also highly effective out of down throw, as it is able to hit opponents who mash out, being an effective kill-confirm at around 90-110%. The plank comes out later and has a big hitbox, but deals less damage and knockback, making it more suited for covering the headbutt or ledgetrapping at best. The plank animation weakly meteor smashes opponents, though this is ineffective for edgeguarding due to its low knockback. In addition, it is the weakest meteor smash in the game, failing to KO at realistic percents. It can be used to force tech situations or awkward placements off-stage, but these are highly situational and impractical. The sheer number of hits do make it useful for causing shield damage under platforms. Each hitbox is situated on K. Rool's head and body respectively, meaning it can miss entirely if used poorly. Additionally, the move has extremely high ending lag, with the first actionable frame being 72 and the last hit being on Frame 23. The headbutt and plank KO at 100% and 162% at the edge of Final Destination, respectively. This move has Belly Super Armor shortly after K. Rool hops and before he flops onto the ground. There are intangibility frames on K. Rool's head when the sweetspot comes out."
"2002","King K. Rool","Down smash","","18%, 4% (quake)","A leaping belly flop, which causes a quake. Has Belly Super Armor during the leap, and deals heavy shield damage. As K. Rool physically leaves the ground when using the move, his hurtbox gets shifted into the air, allowing it to dodge ground or belly-level attacks to deal a hard punish. It is extremely powerful, being one of the strongest down smashes in the game, KOing at 50% at the edge of Final Destination. The move is very laggy overall, with its strongest hitbox coming out on frame 22, and it also suffers from very high ending lag, which makes it very punishable if used poorly. However, thanks to it's initial hop and armor, the move is surprisingly hard to intercept despite it's high startup. It also can be used on platforms against opponents that try to attack K. Rool from below. The quake is extremely weak, but it covers the high ending lag of the move somewhat, and it can occasionally lead to a forward tilt."
"2003","King K. Rool","Neutral aerial","","12%, 8% (late)","Inflates his stomach and performs a splash based on an attack from Donkey Kong Land like his dash attack. Very fast (comes out on frame 7), acts as a sex kick and has Belly Super Armor, making it excellent for contesting with aerials or approaching. This is also his fastest out of shield option next to his neutral attack. It has the lowest ending lag of his aerials, but it has poor range, is unsafe on shield and at low percentages it's not safe on hit."
"2004","King K. Rool","Forward aerial","","14% (sweetspot), 10% (sweetspot, late), 12% (sourspot), 8% (sourspot, late)","A dropkick, similar to Bowser's back aerial. Its sweetspot is at K. Rool's feet. Also acts as a sex kick, allowing it to be used for approaching or edgeguarding. The sweetspot KOs at around 100% near the edge of Final Destination. Hitbox comes out on frame 11. If King K. Rool's body hits at lower percents, it can lead to combos into neutral attack, or down tilt on big body characters like Donkey Kong. The sourspot on this move lies around the torso, and can be used well with Down Tilt."
"2005","King K. Rool","Back aerial","","19% (sweetspot), 14.5% (sourspot)","Turns around and does a delayed downward punch behind him, similar to Mario's forward aerial. It is very slow (comes out on frame 18), but it powerfully meteor smashes opponents if K. Rool's fist hits. Against grounded opponents, it launches them diagonally with extremely high knockback, being able to KO middleweights at 65% near the ledge, making it one of the strongest aerial attacks in the entire game. The sourspot is significantly weaker, however, dealing rather weak diagonal knockback against both grounded and airborne opponents, failing to KO reliably until 160%. It also has a slightly lingering hitbox, making it an important tool in neutral when full hopped. There is a disjoint on the fist, being much larger than it actually is, although the hitboxes are not as strong."
"2006","King K. Rool","Up aerial","","14%, 10% (late)","A headbutt that goes straight upward. Causes K. Rool to float slightly, giving it more reach. It is one of K. Rool's fastest aerial attacks (comes out on frame 7), and deals less damage if hit slightly later. However, it has extremely high ending lag, preventing K. Rool from acting even if performed out of a double jump, making it risky to use offstage and making it the laggiest aerial in the game. The hitbox also doesn't extend beside K. Rool's head. The early hitbox KOs at around 120%. The move has Belly Super Armor while K. Rool stretches his head out, but only for a very limited period of time. When short hopped, this move can allow K. Rool to move onto a platform, allowing for some niche movement options. Like up smash, there intangibility frames on K. Rool's head during the attack. This move can also be used for recovering from high to mid levels, as K. Rool can be moved from side to side while using the move."

Decently fast (comes out on frame 14) and meteor smashes if the early hitbox connects, although the meteor smash itself rather weak. If the opponent is hit by the early hitbox - but not meteor smashed - on-stage against this move, it confirms a wide variety of attacks. There is also a late hitbox with a sweetspot on the hip, with 20 extra stats in knockback growth, plus a sourspot on the feet. It also has Belly Super Armor after K.

It is the most damaging up throw and also the most damaging throw in the game, but KOs late at around 180%. Stages with low upper blast lines and/or high platforms help mitigate this issue, as it carries opponents up in a similar fashion to Charizard's up throw. Can follow up with up tilt or aerials at low percents. With the assistance of soft platforms, this throw is notorious for leading into Propellerpack, which is lethal with incorrect DI."
"2013","King K. Rool","Down throw","Piledriver","5%","Lifts the opponent overhead before slamming them into the ground head-first, burying them. Has the lowest damage output of K. Rool's throws, but this is compensated by its followup potential. K. Rool's most versatile throw overall, as well as one of his most versatile tools in general. Down throw follows up to numerous moves depending on the opponent's percent, including jab, up tilt, and up air at lower to mid percents, as well as forward tilt, forward and down smash at higher percents. It is also possible to infinite many fighters by throwing them, using jab while they're buried and re-grabbing them when they are released. However, most followups can be avoided if the opponent mashes out (especially since the throw itself is slow and gives plenty of time to react), making its kill setups unreliable at much higher percents. Only dash attack, forward and up tilts are able to follow up at 125% and kill reliably. However, up smash and up aerial can be used to discourage mashing and create 50/50 situations at lower percents, as the prior kills at 100% a lot of the time."

After a Kannonball is fired, the special button can be held to use the blunderbuss's vacuum function, sucking in nearby enemies or the Kannonball itself (though the move will eventually cancel after several seconds), similar to Kirby and King Dedede’s Inhale. K. Rool can drop through soft platforms while vacuuming with his blunderbuss, and he also can move left and right as well while airborne, which is very useful for ledgetrapping. Once it sucks something in, K. Rool will immediately launch it out at a slight angle upward in front or behind him, or directly upwards, depending on the held direction. The blunderbuss ""throw"" KOs at 100% near the edge of Final Destination, though it deals lower knockback upwards or if reversed. A launched Fighter or re-launched Kannonball is capable of KOing as early as 70%, with the Kannonball lingering while doing minor damage after the first hit."

Rool fails to catch it, the crown will drop as an item for anyone else to use, and will reappear on his head after 12 seconds or if K. Rool touches it again (does not count if the crown hits him as a thrown item, or if the crown is from another K. Rool). The pickup animation can be cancelled through using a move or ""unavoidable"" animations such as jumpsquat when coming into contact. If an initial dash is performed when coming into contact, King K. Rool will ""slide"" a short distance, giving a minor movement option as well as a 40.8% combo into Down Smash at 0% if the crown hits both times."

Especially for a heavyweight, this recovery covers an excellent amount of distance, allowing K. Rool to fly from one end of Final Destination to the other, though changing direction is difficult. Upon reaching peak height for a moment, K. Rool will slowly drift down while flapping his arms. Pressing down will make K. Rool enter his helpless animation, falling faster and having less landing lag The propellers above K. Rool deal multiple weak hits, protecting him from edgeguards while even allowing him to drag opponents to the top blast line, though this can be DI'd out of if it hits more than 3 times."

It works like a counterattack and can also reflect projectiles. However, the counter hitbox is centered on K.Rool's stomach, making the rest of his body vulnerable (most notably his face), much like the Melee and Brawl versions of Toad. It has a damage multiplier of 1.5x, making it tied with Counter Throw for the second highest damage multiplier out of any counterattack in Ultimate, surpassed only by Tetrakarn. When reflecting, the stomach has a lingering hitbox that deals the minimum damage (12%) and can actually land a KO in niche situations.

"2037","Ridley","Up aerial","","12% (wings), 14% (tip)","Thrusts both wings upward while closed. Has a sweetspot at the tip of the wings, which can KO at around 120% in the air. Its moderate startup and landing lag alongside Ridley's speed make it effective for juggling. On landing, it can also combo into an up tilt or up smash at low percents, as well as any aerial (except down aerial) up to high percents, including a sweetspotted up aerial as a potential KO setup."
"2038","Ridley","Down aerial","","14% (clean, feet), 12% (clean, legs; late)","Plummets down stomping with both feet. A stall-then-fall with a sweetspot on its clean hit that meteor smashes opponents. Unlike most other moves of its kind, Ridley can also recover from it offstage if initiated at least at some height above the stage. However, it has very high landing lag, leaving it unsafe as a landing option and preventing any followups out of its meteor smash onstage. It resembles a move Meta Ridley uses in Metroid Prime."
"2039","Ridley","Grab","","—","Reaches out with his right hand."
"2040","Ridley","Pummel","","1.6%","Thrusts his tail into the opponent."
"2041","Ridley","Forward throw","","9%","Tosses the opponent forward with one arm."
"2042","Ridley","Back throw","","11%","Turns around and performs an underhanded toss with one arm. Can KO at around 150% near the ledge."
"2043","Ridley","Up throw","","8% (hit 1), 4% (throw)","Sets the opponent overhead and stabs them with his tail. Ridley's most damaging throw. Can combo into an up aerial at mid percents if the opponent does not air dodge, and otherwise lead into a frame trap by landing and punishing their air dodge landing lag."
"2044","Ridley","Down throw","","7%","Slams the opponent onto the ground. Has low ending lag, allowing it to combo into an up-angled forward tilt or down tilt at low percents, and a neutral, forward, back aerial or run-canceled up tilt at low to mid percents. Surprisingly, this is also Ridley's strongest throw, being able to KO at around 160%."
"2045","Ridley","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Performs a claw swipe around himself while getting up, starting from the front."
"2046","Ridley","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swings his tail forward, then backward while getting up."
"2047","Ridley","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swipes an arm backward, then kicks forward."
"2048","Ridley","Edge attack","","10%","Climbs up and performs a claw swipe."
"2049","Ridley","Neutral special","Plasma Breath","4.5%-5.66% (clean), 3.5%-4.4% (late)","Spits a fireball from his mouth forward, which bounces along the ground. It can be charged to have Ridley spit up to a maximum of five fireballs, which also increase in size and damage, dealing up to 28.3% if all of them connect. When charged, it is fairly effective for camping and edgeguarding due to its low ending lag and sheer amount of projectiles, and can rack up damage quickly if uninterrupted. However, it has rather high startup, and hitting Ridley's mouth while he is charging the move causes recoil damage to him depending on how much it had been charged. The recoil animation lasts 56 Frames."
"2050","Ridley","Side special","Space Pirate Rush","4% (slam), 2% (drag loop), 7% (throw)","Rushes forward to grab an opponent, functioning as a command grab. If successful, Ridley slams them onto the ground and drags them forward along it, dealing continuous damage, then throws them either upon reaching an edge or if the special move button is held. The move deals more damage the more distance the opponent is dragged along the ground, dealing 17% minimum when throwing manually, and can rack up a lot of damage in a short span of time. However, they can mash out of the move before Ridley throws them, with how fast they can escape depending on the difference between their percent and Ridley's. In midair, it doesn't incur helplessness, allowing it to extend Ridley's recovery, and grabbing an opponent causes him to fall down with them until landing or throwing them manually, allowing it to be used for a sacrificial KO. However, it has some startup lag, and the aerial version causes Ridley to drop downwards after its horizontal momentum ends, making it possible to mistime a recovery."
"2051","Ridley","Up special","Wing Blitz","18% (up), 16% (forward/back), 15% (down), 5% (down, landing)","Charges up, then performs a flying tackle in any of four possible directions: straight up by default; forward and slightly down; backward and slightly up; and down and slightly forward. The move travels a long distance, does not lose power while traveling and is noticeably powerful, with the forward and up tackles KOing under 130% from center stage. The down tackle also meteor smashes aerial targets, while allowing Ridley to save himself by grabbing an edge, making it potentially deadly for edgeguarding. However, the move has very slow startup, and its few angles limit the positions from which Ridley can safely recover with it."
"2052","Ridley","Down special","Skewer","5% (tail), 40% (tip, hit 1), 10% (tip, hit 2)","Brings his tail back as it glows briefly, then stabs forward with it. If hit near the tip of the tail, it deals extremely high damage (50% total) and causes opponents to crumple, akin to a fully charged Focus Attack; both the sweetspot and the sourspot deal minimal shield damage, however. It has a very slow startup of half a second (30 frames), and conversely deals low damage and knockback if any other part of Ridley's tail hits, making it significantly hard to land especially in one-on-one battles. Additionally, the sweetspotted attack only allows Ridley to move after the opponent gets up again, making followup attacks based on reading the opponent's getup option."
"2053","Ridley","Final Smash","Plasma Scream","15% (dash), 40% (cutscene), 15% (release)","Lets out a roar and dashes forward. Upon hitting an opponent, a cinematic sequence begins with Ridley headbutting them onto Samus's gunship; as the gunship flies off, he shoots it down with a laser that engulfs both the ship and the target in an explosion. After the cutscene ends, the opponent is meteor smashed and the gunship can be seen crashing in the background of the stage. This Final Smash is an instant KO on opponents at 100% damage or higher before the cutscene ends."
"2054","Incineroar","Neutral attack","","2.5%","A knifehand strike, followed by a knee lift, followed by an uppercut. If the third hit lands, Incineroar will taunt by pointing its finger towards the ground. Unlike many neutral attacks, holding the attack button only causes Incineroar to do a single attack unless it connects. The first hit can jab reset, and appears almost identical to the Pokémon anime's depiction of Throat Chop."
"2055","Incineroar","Neutral attack","","2.7%","A knifehand strike, followed by a knee lift, followed by an uppercut. If the third hit lands, Incineroar will taunt by pointing its finger towards the ground. Unlike many neutral attacks, holding the attack button only causes Incineroar to do a single attack unless it connects. The first hit can jab reset, and appears almost identical to the Pokémon anime's depiction of Throat Chop."
"2056","Incineroar","Neutral attack","","4.6%","A knifehand strike, followed by a knee lift, followed by an uppercut. If the third hit lands, Incineroar will taunt by pointing its finger towards the ground. Unlike many neutral attacks, holding the attack button only causes Incineroar to do a single attack unless it connects. The first hit can jab reset, and appears almost identical to the Pokémon anime's depiction of Throat Chop."
"2057","Incineroar","Forward tilt","","13%","A knifehand thrust. It is a semi-spike angle and deals high damage for a tilt attack of its speed. These traits make it capable of KOing at 80% from the edge of Final Destination."
"2058","Incineroar","Up tilt","","9%","An upward arcing headbutt. Has a wide hitbox above Incineroar and grants Incineroar's head intangibility (frames 6-11), allowing it to fend off aerial approaches. Combos into itself at 0%, or a neutral aerial or up aerial from 25%-75%. The move has blind spots directly beside Incineroar's legs, meaning it can miss short or prone enemies."
"2059","Incineroar","Down tilt","","9%","A legsweep. Has impressive combo potential, allowing follow-ups into neutral attack or grab at 0%, up tilt from 18%-90%, up smash from 50%-69%, forward aerial from 30%-145%, back aerial from 40%-170%, and up aerial at percentages as high as 210%. Despite only using one leg for the attack, both of Incineroar's legs become intangible during the move: the intangibility for the attacking leg lasts on frames 8-11, while the other leg lasts on frames 9-11."
"2060","Incineroar","Dash attack","","13% (clean), 9% (late)","A dashing knee strike, similar to Zero Suit Samus' dash attack. Deals less damage when late. The clean hit KOs at 102% from the edge of Final Destination. If it lands, Incineroar will kneel on one knee, and point its thumb towards itself while gloating."
"2061","Incineroar","Forward smash","","20% (foot), 16% (leg)","An enzuigiri. If it lands, Incineroar will gloat with its arms spread out, similarly to its down taunt. It has decent range and has a sweetspot on Incineroar's foot, which deals high shield damage. Extremely damaging and powerful without sacrificing in speed, the sweetspot KOs at 39% from the edge of Final Destination. However, the sourspot is underwhelming in comparison."
"2062","Incineroar","Up smash","","17%","An upward double axe handle. If it lands, Incineroar will look to the sky and point upward, and it will clench its fists in dismay if it misses. Starts at ground level and has a rather big hitbox that covers the front of Incineroar and even reaches slightly behind it, all while having intangibility on its arms and hands (frames 13-18). Keeps consistent power throughout the move, and can KO at 116% on Final Destination."
"2063","Incineroar","Down smash","","16%","A jumping splash. If it lands, Incineroar will point its finger upwards while on the floor, and it will pound its fist on the ground angrily if it misses. As Incineroar leaves the ground while using the move, it can dodge ground attacks and act as a hard punish. Sends at a semi-spike angle, deals high shield damage and, like forward smash, it is incredibly powerful, KOing at 62% from the edge of Final Destination. However, it has heavy start-up and ending lag."
"2064","Incineroar","Neutral aerial","","13% (clean), 7% (late)","A splash. Very fast start-up and acts as a sex kick, and also sends at a semi-spike angle. Useful for breaking out of combos. Auto-cancels with a jump."
"2065","Incineroar","Forward aerial","","13% (feet), 12% (legs)","A dropkick. Deals more damage and knockback if the feet hitbox lands. Starts fast enough to hit opponents if buffered from a short hop. Auto-cancels if Incineroar lands before the hitbox appears, allowing it to cancel tumbling. Launches at a semi-spike angle, and can KO at 110% from the edge of Final Destination."
"2066","Incineroar","Back aerial","","13% (feet), 11% (heel)","A back kick. Like forward aerial, it deals more damage and knockback if the feet hitbox lands. Starts fast enough to hit opponents if buffered from a short hop. KOs at 89% from the edge of Final Destination, and auto-cancels with a jump."
"2067","Incineroar","Up aerial","","8%","An outside crescent kick. Has a wide arc, covering above Incineroar, but cannot hit opponents directly next to it. Auto-cancels with a short hop, allowing it to be spammed. Can juggle into itself, but opponents can react out of it. Generally useful for combo chains."
"2068","Incineroar","Down aerial","","15% (feet), 14% (body), 9% (late)","A double foot stomp. Rather slow start-up, but it is a powerful meteor smash if the feet hitbox lands. The body hitbox launches opponents diagonally."
"2069","Incineroar","Grab","","—","Reaches out with both arms to clinch the opponent."
"2070","Incineroar","Pummel","","1.6%","Headbutts the opponent."
"2071","Incineroar","Forward throw","","12% (throw), 6% (front collateral), 4% (back collateral)","A giant swing, similar to Mario and Wario's back throws. Deals collateral damage to bystanders, with the back hit dealing less damage. Sends too far for any follow-ups apart from dash attack at 0% if the opponent misses a tech. Powerful for a throw, KOing at 133% from the edge of Final Destination."
"2072","Incineroar","Back throw","","14% (throw and collateral)","A German suplex. When used right at the edge, it is potentially even stronger than Ness' back throw, being capable of KOing at 90% from the edge of Final Destination. It can even OHKO the lightest characters at the edge of stages while under the influence of Revenge. However, further away from the edge Ness' back throw is still stronger, Incineroar has higher knockback until about 120% where after, Ness' back throw becomes stronger due to higher knockback growth. It can also hit bystanders, as it launches them at a lower angle and KOs them even earlier (at 75%)."
"2073","Incineroar","Up throw","","12%","An Argentine backbreaker rack drop. Incineroar poses with its arms raised and fists clenched upon completion. Has too much ending lag to combo into anything, but can follow up into an up aerial or Cross Chop if the opponent does not react in a sufficient amount of time. Like forward and back throws, it is extremely powerful, KOing at 139% on Final Destination, and KOs significantly earlier when used on a platform."
"2074","Incineroar","Down throw","","9%","A chokeslam. Incineroar pumps its fist upon completion. Unlike Incineroar's other throws, it is a combo starter instead of a KOing option. It has forward smash or dashing up smash as true follow-ups at 0%. It can also combo reliably into Darkest Lariat and neutral aerial at low percents, and forward and up aerials at low to medium percents. Due to Incineroar's overall slow speed, however, its combo potential wanes past medium percents."
"2075","Incineroar","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Swipes around itself."
"2076","Incineroar","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Swipes around itself."
"2077","Incineroar","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swipes behind itself, then punches forward."
"2078","Incineroar","Edge attack","","10%","Swipes forward."
"2079","Incineroar","Neutral special","Darkest Lariat","16% (early), 12%-11% (middle), 10%-8% (late)","Spins rapidly to perform a series of discus lariats. Loses strength as the move goes on. Incineroar gains invincibility during the move (frames 5 and 6 on its whole body; frame 7 on its head and arms; frames 8-57 on just its arms). Starts extremely quickly, and the entire move possesses transcendent priority, allowing it to break through opposing attacks (and weaker projectiles) apart from moves with sufficient range. Incineroar can slowly move left or right by holding a direction, and the move also slows its descent, though its slow speed means it is not suitable for recovery. The early hit KOs at 108% from the edge of Final Destination."
"2080","Incineroar","Side special","Alolan Whip","20% (lariat), 12% (back body drop), 4% (failed throw and recoil)","A command grab involving Incineroar lunging a short distance forward to grab opponents. Victims are thrown against wrestling ropes that appears after the grab connects. Depending on when the special or attack button is pressed after grabbing an opponent, Incineroar will perform one of three different moves: a lariat that launches the opponent the direction Incineroar is facing (input just as the opponent touches Incineroar); a back body drop that launches the opponent vertically (input any time after the opponent rebounds); or a failed attempt that causes the victim to collide against Incineroar's head, dealing 4% to both (too early/no input). Upon executing the lariat, Incineroar poses with its arms in the air and its head tilted upwards. The lariat deals 20% and can KO at 72% from the edge of Final Destination, the back body drop deals 12% and can KO at 159% (or earlier with a low ceiling), while the failed version cannot KO at all (outside of extremely situational gimps). During the throw, Incineroar is granted super armor, and if the opponent is hit out of the move, Incineroar will shrug towards the screen. Does not cause helplessness, which allows Incineroar to use it to extend its recovery."
"2081","Incineroar","Up special","Cross Chop","2.5/3/4/5% (ascent), 3.5% (descent), 11% (direct hit), 9% (close explosion), 5.5% (far explosion)","Leaps upward while engulfed in flames before descending diagonally to perform a cross chop. Incineroar gains super armor a few frames after its initial ascent (frames 4-15), and Incineroar can change its direction right before starting the move. Causes an explosion once Incineroar lands. The rising and descending hits have set knockback, with the descending hit having extremely high base knockback; this is capable of gimping opponents even at 0% for a sacrificial KO, with Incineroar always being KO'd after its opponent. Incineroar's descending body hitbox is similarly powerful, KOing at 75% from the edge of Final Destination, with the explosion being almost as powerful. However, the move has high ending lag. Unlike most up specials, Cross Chop does not render Incineroar helpless (unless Incineroar lands during its descent and does not touch solid ground), though its awkward angle requires it to be used extremely high for recovery, as it is a self-destruct any other way."
"2082","Incineroar","Down special","Revenge","2.4% (close)","Points its chest outward, retaliating against incoming attacks or projectiles. Functions as a counterattack, albeit much differently; Incineroar retaliates with a weak burst of flame, takes significantly reduced damage from the retaliated attack, and its next move is powered up. As a visual indicator, Incineroar's body radiates an orange glow. This buff can stack depending on the number of countered moves and damage resisted. The buff lasts for a very long time (around 60 seconds), though it is reduced slightly each time Incineroar uses an attack and misses, but it is lost entirely if it is grabbed. Once a powered up move lands, the buff is removed. If a smash attack, Cross Chop, or Alolan Whip's lariat lands while Revenge is active, the camera will perform the Special Zoom. At maximum stacks, Incineroar is able to deal an excess of 70% with just a single smash attack, giving it the strongest possible attacks in standard matches. The flame attack also grants intangibility (frames 1-19)."
"2083","Incineroar","Final Smash","Max Malicious Moonsault","3% (start-up), 2% (initial grab), 7% (hit 1-4)","Activates its Incinium Z and lunges forward. Upon grabbing the first victim it comes in contact with, the victim is thrown against the ropes of a wrestling ring. Incineroar then uppercuts the victim upward, dropkicks them even further upward, uppercuts them again, and then finishes with a diving battering ram that sends it and the victim crashing into the ring to generate an explosion within the ring as a boxing bell chimes. The victim is sent flying alongside any bystanders. Can KO as early as 20%.
If Incineroar misses on the ground, it slaps its knee in frustration."
"2084","Isabelle","Neutral attack","","2%","Whacks the opponent with a toy hammer. This move is a single-hit jab with very low knockback. At low percent, the move can hit multiple times due to its speed and low endlag. Can lock. At high percents, it can combo into tilts, down smash, or pocket."
"2085","Isabelle","Forward tilt","","9%","Swings a Candy Umbrella horizontally, much like Villager. Compared to Villager's, it launches at a slightly lower angle and higher knockback growth, but more ending lag."
"2086","Isabelle","Up tilt","","8%","Swings a broom in an arc over her head, starting behind her. Fast and can combo into itself or aerials."
"2087","Isabelle","Down tilt","","13% (close), 8% (far)","Pulls a weed out of the ground, much like Villager. Compared to Villager, this move's sweetspot deals slightly more damage, while the sourspot deals considerably lower damage. It also has marginally less ending lag than Villager's, but a shorter hitbox duration."
"2088","Isabelle","Dash attack","","10% (beginning), 6% (pot)","Similar to Villager's, but with a brown pot instead of a potted sapling. As such, the pot will either break or bounce off the ground after hitting it. The hitbox on the pot disappears after bouncing off the ground. When used near a ledge, will fall off and continue to have a hitbox. Compared to Villager's, the pot does not travel as far, but the move has less ending lag."
"2089","Isabelle","Forward smash","","17% (close)/ 8% (far)","Fires a party popper forward. Strong, but has considerable recovery frames and poor range."
"2090","Isabelle","Up smash","","2% (hit 1), 12% (clean hit 2), 10% (late hit 2)","Blows her whistle, causing a do-not-enter sign to spring up from the ground in front of her. Has 2 hits that connect into each other. Can combo into up aerial at low percents."
"2091","Isabelle","Down smash","","10% (front), 8% (back)","Splashes a pail of water back and forth, similar to Inkling's Slosher, but considerably faster and with less range. Sends opponents at a very low angle."
"2092","Isabelle","Neutral aerial","","10% (clean), 6% (late)","Twirls around twice in the air while holding pom-poms. The weak hit can lock at low percents."
"2093","Isabelle","Forward aerial","","7% (clean), 4% (mid), 2.5% (late)","Fires a pellet from a slingshot in front of her. Functionally identical to Villager's."
"2094","Isabelle","Back aerial","","9% (clean), 5% (mid), 3% (late)","Fires a pellet from a slingshot behind her. Functionally identical to Villager's."
"2095","Isabelle","Up aerial","","10% (clean), 5% (late)","Swings turnips above her head. Unlike Villager's, she will always swing two turnips, making it more consistent but removing the chance of getting more knockback with three turnips."
"2096","Isabelle","Down aerial","","10% (clean), 5% (late)","Swings turnips below her body. Similar to her up air, she will always swing two turnips, making it more consistent than Villager but removing the chance of getting more knockback with three turnips. Hitting clean with the ends of the turnips will meteor smash opponents; any other part of the turnips will launch opponents horizontally."
"2097","Isabelle","Grab","Net","—","Swings a net down in front of her, much like Villager. As such, using her grab on an item will cause her to pocket it. Notably, all four of Villager's throws were altered somewhat on transition to Ultimate, with Isabelle's throws retaining Villager's throw properties from Smash 4. Isabelle's dash grab also has 1 frame less startup that Villager's."
"2098","Isabelle","Pummel","","1%","Yanks the net backwards, similar to Villager."
"2099","Isabelle","Forward throw","","9%","Tosses the opponent out of the net with an overhead swing. Its low knockback scaling makes it best suited for throwing opponents off the stage to setup edgeguards."
"2100","Isabelle","Back throw","","11%","Turns around, tossing the opponent out of the net with a horizontal swing. Isabelle's strongest throw, and the only one that can KO at high percents."
"2101","Isabelle","Up throw","","10%","Flips the net over and tosses the opponent upward."
"2102","Isabelle","Down throw","","6%","Turns her net horizontally and slams it on the ground. Can combo into aerials at low to mid percents."
"2103","Isabelle","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Isabelle swings a broom in front, and then behind her."
"2104","Isabelle","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Same as her other floor attack, but swings the broom behind her first."
"2105","Isabelle","Floor attack (trip)","","5%","Swings a broom in front, then behind herself while getting up."
"2106","Isabelle","Edge attack","","9%","Isabelle slides along the ground and shoves with pom-poms in her hands."
"2107","Isabelle","Neutral special","Pocket","1.9x (multiplier)","Pockets projectiles and items, similar to Villager. After pocketing a projectile, using the neutral special input will produce and use the projectile. Using neutral special with a pocketed item will put the item in Isabelle's hand."
"2108","Isabelle","Side special","Fishing Rod","~9.5%-18.7%","Casts out a fishing rod. The distance it is cast depends on whether or not it was inputted while flicking the stick. It can be left out for a period of time, before Isabelle will automatically begin to slowly reel it in. Pressing the special or attack button will automatically reel it in completely at any time. When an opponent is captured by the fishing rod, she reels them in and can throw the opponent in one of 4 directions. The forward and up variants can kill at high percents, while the down variant can combo until high percents. The damage dealt varies, but what determines it is currently unknown. The fishing rod can also be used as a tether recovery and can also grab items. Unlike normal grabs, it cannot grab opponents through shield, even when reeled in."
"2109","Isabelle","Up special","Balloon Trip","0%","Sits on a swing with two bunny balloons. Nearly identical to Villager's variant, and grants a lot of distance, though it travels a shorter distance than Villager's. Pressing or holding the special button will cause Isabelle to rise. Pressing the attack button will cancel the move while propelling her slightly upwards. If cancelled with the attack button, the next use will only have one balloon until landing on stage."
"2110","Isabelle","Down special","Lloid Trap","1.6% (hits 1 & 2), 0.9% (hits 3 - 5), 12% (hit 6)","Plants the Gyroid Lloid into the ground. When someone steps over him, or when the down special is inputted again, Lloid shoots out vertically, dragging the opponent with him. If nothing happens for 10 seconds, the trap will disappear. After taking 8% damage, not counting the 1v1 multiplier, he will explode, which will damage Isabelle if she is near the explosion."
"2111","Isabelle","Final Smash","Dream Town Hall","50.5% (entire), 10% (collateral loop), 15% (collateral explosion)","When activated, Tom Nook and the Nooklings come and build a town hall, trapping opponents that got caught in the Final Smash. Once the town hall is completed, it explodes, dealing high knockback and damage. While similar to Villager's variant, it deals more knockback and damage. The final hit is also faster."
"2112","Inkling","Neutral attack","","2%","A knifehand strike, followed by a mid-level roundhouse kick, followed by a side kick. If the button is mashed, the second hit is followed by a rapid series of spurts from the Splattershot that concludes with a single blast that launches the enemy. The neutral infinite covers opponents in ink. If the Inkling's Ink Tank is empty, the neutral infinite and finisher deal no damage and knockback. The first hit can lock."
"2113","Inkling","Neutral attack","","2%","A knifehand strike, followed by a mid-level roundhouse kick, followed by a side kick. If the button is mashed, the second hit is followed by a rapid series of spurts from the Splattershot that concludes with a single blast that launches the enemy.

"2115","Inkling","Neutral attack","","0.4% (loop), 2.5% (last)","A knifehand strike, followed by a mid-level roundhouse kick, followed by a side kick. If the button is mashed, the second hit is followed by a rapid series of spurts from the Splattershot that concludes with a single blast that launches the enemy. The neutral infinite covers opponents in ink. If the Inkling's Ink Tank is empty, the neutral infinite and finisher deal no damage and knockback. The first hit can lock."
"2116","Inkling","Forward tilt","","9%","Swings the Splattershot downward. It has average knockback and range, and can KO at very high percentages."
"2117","Inkling","Up tilt","","6%","A bicycle kick. Can combo into itself up to three times at 0% or twice at low percents, and into aerials at higher percents. Despite its animation, it has blind spots directly beside Inkling, and is unable to hit prone opponents."
"2118","Inkling","Down tilt","","3% (hit 1), 6% (hit 2)","A windmill. Hits twice, and can KO at high percents, low-profile certain moves, and hit most ledge hangs."
"2119","Inkling","Dash attack","","8% (clean), 6% (late)","An elbow smash. Good as a burst option or punish option, although it struggles to KO even at very high percents."
"2120","Inkling","Forward smash","Inkbrush","16% (ink, Inkbrush), 14% (ink, handle), 12% (no ink)","Swings an Inkbrush outward, which covers opponents in ink. Has a sweetspot at the brush's tip. The hitbox does not cover the splatter of paint from the Inkbrush. KOs at 90% at the edge of Final Destination (with ink available), making for a very potent kill move, especially with its disjoint."
"2121","Inkling","Up smash","Blaster","4% (hit 1), 15% (hit 2, ink, center), 10% (hit 2, ink, outer) 10% (hit 2, no ink, center) 6% (hit 2, no ink, outer)","Fires a Blaster upward, which covers opponents in ink. There is a hitbox next to the Inkling that launches the enemy into the air before the shot goes off, setting the enemy up for the attack; this hitbox can even pick up prone or buried opponents.

"2122","Inkling","Down smash","Slosher","12.5% (hit 1, ink, close), 7% (hit 1, ink, far), 11% (hit 2, ink, close), 6% (hit 2, ink, far),  10% (hit 1, no ink, close), 5% (hit 1, no ink, far), 9% (hit 2, no ink, close), 4% (hit 2, no ink, far)","Empties out a Slosher forward and then backward, which covers opponents in ink. The back hit deals less damage and knockback. The first hit KOs at 104% on Final Destination (with ink available). Useful for roll reads, for reading ledge options, or against ledge hangs."
"2123","Inkling","Neutral aerial","","7%","An aerial headspin. Despite its appearance, it has no lasting hitbox, and the move only covers Inkling's legs. Can combo into jab, grab, tilts, or back aerial. Can be used twice or followed by back aerial in a single short hop."
"2124","Inkling","Forward aerial","","12% (feet), 10% (legs), 7% (late)","A dropkick. Has some startup and acts as a sex kick. When sweetspotted, it is one of Inkling's most reliable aerial KO moves. KOs at 136% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2125","Inkling","Back aerial","","10% (nozzle), 7.5% (handle)","Swings the Splattershot backward. The move sports one of the larger disjointed hitboxes in Inkling's moveset, and its low landing and ending lag makes it one of the Inkling's safest moves for approaching and spacing. Is capable of a pseudo-wall of pain in certain situations. One of Inkling's best edgeguarding options due to its good knockback and frame data."
"2126","Inkling","Up aerial","","4.5% (hit 1), 6.5% (hit 2)","A 540 kick. The first hit has set knockback and uses the autolink angle, allowing it to set up into tilts, jab, or grab. The second hit has strong knockback at higher percents, making for a decent KO option. The animation is misleading, as the attack does not extend much horizontally."
"2127","Inkling","Down aerial","","12% (nozzle), 10% (handle)","Briefly rears back before swinging the Splattershot downward. The sweetspot is at the Splattershot's nozzle and will meteor smash, while the sourspot deals strong horizontal knockback."
"2128","Inkling","Grab","","—","Reaches out with the free hand."
"2129","Inkling","Pummel","","1.2%","Stomps on the opponent's foot."
"2130","Inkling","Forward throw","","5% (hit 1, ink), 3% (hit 2)","Fires the Splattershot at point-blank range. Hits twice, with the second hit covering the opponent in ink. Without ink, the first hit deals no damage. Has very weak knockback and will never KO, even at Sudden Death percents. The collateral hit has set knockback and will not KO even at 999%, making it near useless in doubles."
"2131","Inkling","Back throw","","9%","Transforms into squid form, then spins and uses the tentacles to toss the opponent behind. Inkling's best kill throw, KOing at 129% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2132","Inkling","Up throw","","3% (hit 1), 3% (hit 2)","Tosses the opponent upward, then turns into squid form to headbutt them from below. Sends the opponent directly upwards. Can combo reliably into neutral aerial and up aerial at low to mid percents, and at higher percents up aerial can kill out of up throw."
"2133","Inkling","Down throw","","7%","Slams the opponent head-first into the ground with one hand. Sends the opponent in front, allowing it to combo into tilts or jab depending on the opponent. KOs off the top blastzone at 209% on Final Destination."
"2134","Inkling","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Shoots the Splattershot on both sides of the Inkling. Despite its appearance, the move does not apply ink to opponents."

"2138","Inkling","Neutral special","Splattershot","0.3% (above Ink Tank line), 0.2% (below Ink Tank line), 0.1% (almost empty)","Rapidly fires the Splattershot, which covers opponents in ink at a fast pace. Only causes hitstun at very close range (3 character lengths), and slowly pushes opponents back at any further distance. Due to its high fire rate, it can lock opponents in shieldstun. Can be angled up and down, but the projectiles disappear after a set distance.  If the Ink Tank goes below the labeled line, both the projectiles and the close-range hitbox will shorten and lose damage. If this move is used without any ink, the Inkling will begin charging ink."
"2139","Inkling","Side special","Splat Roller","11% (grounded, ink), 2%-3% (moving after Ink Tank is empty)","Wields a Roller and begins to slide it forward. The Roller spreads ink across the floor, with inked surfaces slowing opponents down. If Inkling and the opponent are grounded, it will bury them and cover them in ink, allowing for followups. The damage, bury duration and ink applied are determined by how fast Inkling is moving. If the target is already buried, Inkling is airborne, or the Roller is moving too slow, it will apply ink but knock the opponent upward instead of burying them. If the opponent is airborne, the Roller will not hit them. After rolling for a set distance, Inkling can cancel the move with the special or attack button, jump out of the animation, turn around by pressing back, or maintain her speed by holding forward. Otherwise the move will slow down until it no longer deals damage. In the air, the Roller can only be used once before landing, but jumping out of the move does not use a double jump, allowing it to extend Inkling's recovery. If Roller is started without ink, the Inkling will slowly walk forward with a dejected look, and cannot speed up or deal damage. If Inkling runs out of ink mid-Roller, the attack will deal damage if it is still traveling fast enough, but will not bury or apply ink. The Splat Roller is core to Inkling's KO setups and neutral game, and is primarily used to finish off opponents at higher percents with a smash attack."
"2140","Inkling","Up special","Super Jump","8% (close), 6% (far), 8% (landing)","Performs a Super Jump. The move deals minor damage and knockback on startup, and also when Inkling lands, giving it some safety. It rises very high into the air, and can be angled left or right. However, the move is somewhat linear, the initial hitbox lasts only a few frames, the rising and falling animations do not deal damage, and if Inkling does not grab the ledge, the landing animation can be punished."
"2141","Inkling","Down special","Splat Bomb","9.4%-15%","Throws a Splat Bomb, which explodes on contact or after a fixed time, covering opponents in ink. The damage and amount of ink applied increase based on how long the player holds the special button. This also controls the bomb's trajectory: a toss upward if uncharged, or a long-distance fling forward if fully charged. If used uncharged, the Splat Bomb takes a short delay after contact with an enemy before exploding. Has multiple uses, including edgeguarding, setting traps, or KOing at high percents. If this move is used without any ink, the Inkling will begin charging ink. If the Ink Tank is not empty but is below the labeled meter, the Inkling will be incapable of throwing a Splat Bomb, and will instead look back at the Ink Tank, leaving Inkling open for attack. When fully charged, it KOs at 143% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2142","Inkling","Final Smash","Killer Wail","1% (hits 1-32), 8% (hit 33)","Wields the Killer Wail to emit a stream of damaging sound waves, which after a short period of time, are replaced with ink. Although the sound waves can be angled similarly to Phazon Laser and Aura Storm, the player also retains full control of Inkling while it is active. The looping hits cover opponents in ink, but only the final hit has KO potential, KOing at around 60%."
"2143","Ken","Neutral attack","Inazuma Kick[2] (held, far)","1.5% (hits 1 and 2)","Tapped: A jab, followed by a short straight-punch, followed by a hook. The second hit is based on Ken's Street Fighter III close medium punch. The first and second hits can be special-canceled, and are also able to lock.
Held (far): Ken performs his Inazuma Kick: a double-hitting axe kick. It is somewhat hard to land both hits, as the range tends to overlap with his close variant. This move causes Ken to slightly move forward, and deals a good amount of shield damage; coupled with its ability to be followed up from Ken's unique roundhouse kicks, it is useful for shield pressure. Cannot be special-cancelled.
Held (close): An uppercut similar to his held up tilt, but with significantly different properties, doing virtually no knockback and being special-cancellable. This makes it extremely potent for combos, reliably cancelling into Shoryuken even at high percents."

Combos well out of his tapped tilt attacks and aerials, and is mainly used to rack up damage due to its low damage outputs, knockback and slow speed. Both variants can cancel into his Final Smash.

The multi-hits can also drag opponents offstage at low percents, making it effective against characters with poor recoveries. However, Ken's Tatsumaki Senpukyaku deals significantly less knockback than Ryu's, repurposing the move from a KOing option into a combo starter and combo extender.

Ken's Shoryuken deals less knockback than Ryu's equivalent and hits at a slightly more horizontal angle. However, it deals more damage and has powerful hitboxes throughout the move (in contrast to Ryu's Shoryuken, which loses strength the longer it is out). Shoryuken can also drag enemies upwards, letting it kill earlier when close to the top. Depending on how long the button is pressed, Ken's Shoryuken will hit a different amount of times: tapping the button fast causes it to hit once, tapping the button at a mid-fast speed causes it to hit twice, and holding the button performs Heavy Shoryuken: a flaming Shoryuken that hits 3 times.

At any other range, Ken performs the Shinryuken, an uppercut which produces a giant pillar of fire with immense vertical range."
"2174","Simon","Neutral attack","","2%","Swings the Vampire Killer twice while holding it lengthwise, with his left hand holding its chain.

It has high range for its speed, comes out on frame 12 and has low ending lag. This makes it useful for general spacing. However, only the initial whip lash deals damage, and opponents can crouch under it. The tip of the chain deals more damage, and can KO at around 120% at the edge of Final Destination. If the attack button is held, Simon will transition into the Whip Twirl, identical to his neutral attack."
"2179","Simon","Up tilt","","10% (whip), 2% (close)","A quick whip twirl in a lasso-like fashion that covers above his head. The earliest hitbox starts slightly above Simon's face, and moves left and right once. Provides excellent coverage above Simon, granting it good pressuring capabilities against aerial opponents. It can also potentially chain into itself more than once at low percents and can KO at very high percents. However, it has no grounded hitboxes beside him whatsoever, making it risky against grounded opponents. The move also has a very weak hitbox when the chain first comes out, though it has no typical use."
"2180","Simon","Down tilt","Sliding","5% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2), 3.5% (hit 2, late)","A slide kick based on Richter Belmont's Slide and Jumping Slide from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The first hit is incapable of KOing even at 999%, but if the button is pressed again, Simon does a jumping kick that carries his momentum, comboing from the first hit. The jump deals less damage late, and is capable of jumping off platforms and edges. The first hit allows Simon to slide under projectiles or high hitboxes.

The sweetspot can KO as early as 57% from the edge of Final Destination, and if fully charged, can KO as early as 30% on lighter characters. It is safe on shield when sweetspotted due to its sheer distance, and deals respectable damage to shields. The rest of the move is punishable on shield due to its high lag overall, and opponents can crouch under the chain. If angled down, the sweetspot can hit ledge hanging opponents."
"2183","Simon","Up smash","","16% (spiked ball), 14% (chain)","A vertical whip crack. It has immense vertical range, being able to reach as high as the top platform of Battlefield, but its hitbox is strictly vertical, incapable of hitting anyone directly beside Simon or the chain, even if the opponent is practically touching him. The hitbox is also very narrow, making positioning important. Due to its high ending lag, this makes the move suited solely for aerial targets. While hard to hit, the sweetspot has extreme power, KOing as early as 67% on Final Destination. It can combo from up throw at 0-30%, though opponents can DI away from this."

It can be angled slightly upward and downward at roughly a 20 degree angle; if angled down, the move can hit grounded opponents. Excellent range, allowing it to hit distant targets easily. However, the hitboxes are slim and have a short duration, while the move has some startup, requiring precise use. Has low ending lag, allowing Simon to double jump and perform another aerial if done from a short hop. Also can be used as a tether recovery, which is useful as Simon has no horizontal recovery options otherwise. The sweetspot can KO from 125% at the edge of Final Destination."

Has more knockback growth despite the similar damage, with the sweetspot KOing from 110% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2188","Simon","Up aerial","","12% (spiked ball), 10% (chain), 2% (body)","Rears back and performs a long-ranged whip crack directly above him. Functionally identical to forward and back aerials in all aspects apart from attack direction and the inability to be angled. Like forward and up aerials, Simon can double jump and perform another aerial if done from a short hop, and it also acts as a tether recovery, covering around the same distance as Uppercut. The sweetspot KOs from 100% while in the air."
"2189","Simon","Down aerial","Jump Kick","12%, 7% (late)","A stall-then-fall divekick, based on the ability both Simon and Richter can obtain in Castlevania: Harmony of Despair. Goes downward at a diagonal angle, with the first two frames being a meteor smash. If hit, Simon will bounce back with a flourish, which can combo into other attacks: the early hit easily combos into forward or back aerials at medium percents, Uppercut at 100% or above as a KO combo, or even into itself at low percents. However, its dangerous to use offstage, since Simon's recovery is very poor and the duration of the move will most likely lead to a self-destruct if used carelessly"
"2190","Simon","Grab","","—","Reaches with his left arm. Notably, while Simon can use his whip as a tether recovery, he does not use it to grab opponents."
"2191","Simon","Pummel","","1.2%","Hits the opponent with his knee. Average speed and damage."
"2192","Simon","Forward throw","","7%","Spins once and flings the opponent forward. If the opponent misses a tech, it can be followed up with forward smash, forward tilt or dash attack at 0%. Tech rolls can be caught with Axe. Simon's strongest throw, capable of KO'ing from 125% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2193","Simon","Back throw","","7%","Flings the opponent backwards with both arms. Has the same combos as forward throw, but it is weaker for KOing, as it does so from 145% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2194","Simon","Up throw","","6% (hit 1), 4% (hit 2)","Heaves the opponent into the air before lashing at them with the Vampire Killer. One of Simon's most useful throws due to its setup ability and damage, being the most damaging throw in his moveset. Can initiate combos at 0% such as into up smash, the later hitboxes of Uppercut, or start aerial juggles. At higher percents, it can set up into up aerial for a KO, though opponents can DI this."
"2195","Simon","Down throw","","8%","A chokeslam. Like forward and back throws, it can follow up with forward smash or forward tilt at 0%, or cover tech rolls with Axe. Can also lead into a second hit of a down tilt at low percents."
"2196","Simon","Floor attack (front)","","7%","Kicks behind, then in front of himself."
"2197","Simon","Floor attack (back)","","7%","Kicks behind, then in front of himself."

"2199","Simon","Edge attack","","9%","Kicks forward while getting up."
"2200","Simon","Neutral special","Axe","15%","Throws an axe projectile that travels at a high parabolic arc. The angle can be changed by holding forward or back before throwing. Simon's aerial momentum is stopped once he throws the axe. Extremely high startup lag, with the axe's angle making it ineffective to use conventionally. However, it deals high damage and knockback while also going through solid terrain, giving it powerful edgeguarding capabilities. Its high freeze frames also give it a useful, albeit very limited followup ability. The axe can KO grounded opponents from 140% on Final Destination."
"2201","Simon","Side special","Cross","6%, 8% (smash thrown), 5% (returning)","Flings a silver cross projectile that functions similarly to Boomerang, including the ability to be smash-thrown to fly further and deal more damage. Unlike Boomerang, the Cross makes no attempt to return to Simon, and only flies straight forward and back. The Cross reaches the edge of Final Destination if thrown from the middle, and will travel to the other edge if left uncaught. Only one Cross can be out, and Simon can catch it upon returning. This is generally Simon's main stage-control tool to interrupt approaches and initiate combos. Simon may occasionally say ""Begone!"""
"2202","Simon","Up special","Uppercut","2% (hit 1), 1.5% (hit 2-5), 6% (hit 6)","A rising uppercut with the Vampire Killer in hand. Simon's main recovery move, though its poor height and Simon's limited air mobility makes it difficult to use as a recovery. Functions better as an attack, as it starts up quickly, can punish aerial opponents, and combos reliably from down aerial. KOs rather late on the ground, though it can KO much earlier as an aerial combo finisher as early as 120%. However, it has significantly lower range compared to Simon's other attacks."
"2203","Simon","Down special","Holy Water","2.9% (flask), 1.3% (flames, hits 1-8)","Drops a flask of Holy Water diagonally downwards. Once it hits the ground or an opponent, the flask bursts and unleashes a pillar of red flames. Only one flask or pillar of flame can exist at one time. If the flask is caught, it will become an item that opponents can use against Simon. It can also be reflected, perfect shielded or hit back to affect the Simon who threw it. Has similar functionality as PK Fire, keeping opponents trapped within the projectile and in position for a followup, and lacks a final stronger hit. Rather infamous for being the setup to a forward smash at ledge."
"2204","Simon","Final Smash","Grand Cross","3% (trapping hit), 10% (final hit)","Summons a large coffin in front of him, which traps opponents that touch it the moment it appears. If successful, Simon grabs the coffin with the Vampire Killer's chain, swings it in a wide arc and hauls it skywards, then unleashes the devastating Grand Cross technique while flexing, blasting the coffin with magical crosses and sending the victims flying. Extremely powerful, able to KO as early as 25%."
"2205","Richter","Neutral attack","","2%","Swings the Vampire Killer twice while holding it lengthwise, with his left hand holding its chain. Mashing the attack button quickly will cause Richter to rapidly spin the whip to damage opponents, with a final uppercut that sends opponents away. If not done quickly enough, Richter will cancel the first two hits, ending the attack and leaving him vulnerable. This move is Richter's fastest option up close.
If the attack button is held down instead, Richter will hold out the Vampire Killer, and it can then be manually twirled around. This attack is based on Simon's Whip Twirl from Super Castlevania IV (and was also used by Richter himself in Symphony of the Night), and it is functionally similar to Sheik's Chain in Melee and Brawl. The chain deals minor damage in this way, but can cancel very weak projectiles that collide with it. The spiked ball of the chain is its sweetspot, which deals more damage and sends opponents away."

"2209","Richter","Forward tilt","","12% (spiked ball), 10% (chain)","The iconic whip strike from the original Castlevania. It has high range for its speed, and low ending lag. This makes it useful for general spacing. However, only the initial whip lash deals damage, and opponents can crouch under it. The tip of the chain deals more damage, and can KO at around 120% at the edge of Final Destination. If the attack button is held, Richter will transition into the Whip Twirl, identical to his held neutral attack."
"2210","Richter","Up tilt","","10% (whip), 2% (close)","A quick whip twirl in a lasso-like fashion that covers above his head. The earliest hitbox starts slightly above Richter's face, and moves left and right once. Provides excellent coverage above Richter, granting it good pressuring capabilities against aerial opponents. It can also potentially chain into itself more than once at low percents. However, it has no grounded hitboxes beside him whatsoever, making it risky against grounded opponents. The move also has a very weak hitbox when the chain first comes out, though it has no typical use."
"2211","Richter","Down tilt","Sliding","5% (hit 1), 7% (hit 2), 3.5% (hit 2, late)","A slide kick based on his Slide and Jumping Slide abilities from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The first hit is incapable of KOing even at 999%, but if the button is pressed again, Richter does a jumping kick that carries his momentum, comboing from the first hit. The jump deals less damage late, and is capable of jumping off platforms and edges. The first hit allows Richter to slide under projectiles or high hitboxes. The second hit can KO beginning at 140% from the edge of Final Destination."
"2212","Richter","Dash attack","","1.7% (hits 1-5), 3.5% (end)","A dashing attack while twirling the Vampire Killer beside himself. Based on his Blade Dash from Symphony of the Night. The dash covers half of Final Destination. Capable of destroying weak projectiles, but extremely damaged opponents may be knocked out before the final hit. The move is also one of the few attacks that can still cross-up in Ultimate."
"2213","Richter","Forward smash","","18% (spiked ball), 16% (chain), 14% (chain, close)","Rears back before performing a long-ranged whip crack while taking a step forward. Can be angled. Has tremendous reach, being the longest non-projectile forward smash in the game (outperforming Corrin, Mii Gunner, and Shulk). Deals the most damage at the tip of the chain, and less when up close. The sweetspot can KO as early as 57% from the edge of Final Destination, is safe on shield due to its sheer distance, and deals respectable damage to shields. The rest of the move is punishable on shield, and opponents can crouch under the chain. If angled down, the sweetspot can hit ledge hanging opponents."
"2214","Richter","Up smash","","16% (spiked ball), 14% (chain)","A vertical whip crack. It has immense vertical range, but its hitbox is incapable of hitting anyone directly beside Richter or the chain. Due to its high ending lag, this makes the move suited solely for aerial targets. While hard to hit, the sweetspot can KO as early as 67% on Final Destination. It can combo from up throw at 0-30%, though opponents can DI away from this."
"2215","Richter","Down smash","","16% (spiked ball), 14% (chain), 12% (chain, close)","Drags the Vampire Killer across the ground from forward to back. Impressive overall range like his other smash attacks, and also deals less damage up close in a similar fashion. Both hits do the same amount of damage, with the first hit being rather fast. The sweetspot KOs as early as 85% from the edge of Final Destination. If not sweetspotted, the move is punishable."
"2216","Richter","Neutral aerial","","1% (hits 1-6), 4% (end)","Twirls the Vampire Killer around his body. Lacks the range of his usual moves, but deals multiple hits and can protect Richter from being pursued aerially. Has slightly deceptive range due to the twirling graphic, and only covers one character length around him. The looping hits send at the autolink angle, allowing a falling neutral aerial to combo into a grab, neutral attack, or other moves."
"2217","Richter","Forward aerial","","12% (spiked ball), 10% (chain), 2% (body)","Rears back and performs a long-ranged whip crack. It can be angled slightly upward and downward at roughly a 20 degree angle; if angled down, the move can hit grounded opponents. Excellent range, allowing it to hit distant targets easily. However, the hitboxes are slim and have a short duration, while the move has some startup, requiring precise use. Has low ending lag, allowing Richter to double jump and perform another aerial if done from a short hop. Also can be used as a tether recovery, which is useful as Richter has no horizontal recovery options otherwise. The sweetspot can KO from 125% at the edge of Final Destination."
"2218","Richter","Back aerial","","12% (spiked ball), 10% (chain), 2% (body)","Rears back and performs a long-ranged whip crack behind himself. Identical damage, properties and usage as forward aerial, and can also be aimed up and down.

Once it hits the ground or an opponent, the flask bursts and unleashes a pillar of blue flames. Only one flask or pillar of flame can exist at one time. If the flask is caught, it will become an item that opponents can use against Richter. It can also be reflected or perfect shielded to affect the Richter who threw it. Has similar functionality as PK Fire, keeping opponents trapped within the projectile and in position for a followup, and lacks a final stronger hit. Richter will say ""Take this!"" when performing the move unlike Simon who simply grunts.
This is the only functionally different attack Richter has compared to Simon's; Richter's version does not deal flame damage, which is due to it using blue ""fire"" particles as opposed to Simon's red ones. Instead, it deals aura damage, but its damage output does not scale with Richter's damage percentage unlike any of Lucario's aura-based moves."
"2235","Richter","Final Smash","Grand Cross","3% (trapping hit), 10% (final hit)","Summons a large coffin in front of him, which traps opponents that touch it the moment it appears.

"2236","Joker","Neutral attack","","2%/0.7%","Joker: Performs an inward slash, backhanded stab, then an outward slash.Arsene: Performs an upward swipe, downwards finger point, then a hand thrust.

The first two hits can jab lock. Functions as a typical get-off me and is one of Joker's quickest punishes."
"2239","Joker","Forward tilt","","3% (hit 1), 5%/5% (hit 2)","Joker: Performs a double thrust with his knife, with the second thrust going at a higher angle.Arsene: Thrusts his right hand forward before raising it in a beckoning gesture.
The move can be angled, and both hits are performed with one button press. With Arsene, the second hit is capable of KOing Mario from the edge of Final Destination at around 125%. Useful as a spacing tool due to its range, with Joker moving forward at a decent distance after the first hit and the hitbox in the second hit reaches even over the knife. Comes out on frame 8 and is a very useful defensive option."
"2240","Joker","Up tilt","","4% (hit 1), 1%/0.7% (hits 2-4), 1%/3.9% (hit 5)","Joker: An upwards swing with his knife that sends it spinning into the air, before Joker catches it backhandedly.Arsene: Raises his hand with a beckoning gesture, emanating electricity from his palm.
The initial swing sends opponents into the spinning knife, which deals multiple hits before sending opponents vertically. With Arsene, the looping hits gain an electric effect, and can KO at around 135%. The move cannot hit opponents behind Joker. Useful for anti-airing opponents that are in close proximity to Joker."
"2241","Joker","Down tilt","","6%/7%","Joker: A baseball slide.Arsene: A baseball slide alongside Joker.
Based off of Joker's ability to slide under lasers in Persona 5. Unlike similar moves like Cloud's and Simon's, Joker's down tilt does not lose strength during the late hitboxes. Easily leads into up tilt and aerial attacks until high percents."
"2242","Joker","Dash attack","","2% (hit 1), 6%/6% (hit 2)","Joker: Performs a roundhouse kick followed by a spinning side kick.Arsene: A delayed football kick, which comes out alongside Joker's second kick.
With Arsene, the second hit can KO at the edge at around 105%.
The speed and distance of this move make it one of Joker's best punishing tools, and it can cross-up opponent's shields when used at a certain distance."
"2243","Joker","Forward smash","","14%/8%","Joker: Rears back and swings downwards with both hands directly in front of him.Arsene: Swings his arms downwards, causing an X-shaped slash in front of the duo.
Moves Joker slightly forward while attacking. Without Arsene, the move KOs at around 76% from the edge of the stage, making it Joker's strongest finisher. However, despite Joker moving forward, its range is rather poor due to the length of his knife. Oddly, despite the knife leaving a trail that extends behind Joker, the attack can only hit in front of him. With Arsene, the move gains slightly more range and high KO power, KOing at around 55% from the edge of the stage. Can be an extremely potent punish or trapping tool, but its lag makes it highly punishable itself so it should be used with caution."
"2244","Joker","Up smash","","12%/5%","Joker: Spins inwards while facing the screen, performing a knife uppercut with his right arm.Arsene: Waves his left arm above himself.
Has low horizontal range and a short-lasting hitbox, but covers above Joker, making it a good anti-air. Like up tilt, this move cannot hit enemies behind Joker. With Arsene, the move gains extra range and KO power. KOs at around 130%/100% (without/with Arsene). Joker's fastest smash attack and strongest punish tool against enemies directly above him. Particularly effective against opponents on platforms. Resembles the second hit of Joker's standard three hit attack in Persona 5."
"2245","Joker","Down smash","","12%/6%","Joker: Sweeps the floor with a knife swipe in front of himself, then behind.Arsene: Kicks in front, then behind himself.
Both hits deal the same amount of damage and lack reach, though Arsene boosts its range slightly. KOs at around 112%/73% near the edge (without/with Arsene). Functions as a typical sweeping smash attack and should be used to punish people who air dodge onto the ground or roll behind Joker. Resembles the first hit of Joker's standard three hit attack in Persona 5."
"2246","Joker","Neutral aerial","","7%/4%","Joker: Strikes in a circle while doing two inward corkscrews in the air.Arsene: Lays his back against Joker and slashes alongside him, forming a perfect circle slash around the duo.
Serves as one of Joker's best spacing tools, having good range around him, though it has a very small hitbox located on the knife and the lack of shield pressure can make it risky when used carelessly. It also autocancels late, only doing so in a double jump. On hit it can lead to combos from down tilt, and it can condition the opponent into blocking making it good for granting grab opportunities."
"2247","Joker","Forward aerial","","2% (hit 1), 5%/8% (hit 2)","Joker: A hook kick, followed by a roundhouse kick.Arsene: A delayed roundhouse kick that comes out alongside Joker's second kick.
The first kick has low knockback growth and sends opponents lightly upwards, allowing it to initiate aerial combos into itself or other aerials; it can even catch air dodges with a smash attack. With Arsene, the second kick becomes a powerful KO move that can KO opponents at 100% from the edge."
"2248","Joker","Back aerial","","9%/7%","Joker: An upward swipe behind himself.Arsene: A swift downward chop of his hand, causing the duo's attacks to interlock with each other.
Wide hitbox, but lacks reach for both versions. It's an effective pressure tool against onstage and especially offstage opponents due to its incredible speed and low lag. With Arsene, its hitbox size increases due to Arsene mirroring Joker's attack, and it is capable of KOing at around 90% from the edge, making it a potent KO option. Joker's only aerial that can autocancel in a short hop."
"2249","Joker","Up aerial","","0.75% (hits 1-4), 3%/7% (hit 5)","Joker: A corkscrew flying kick with a finishing kick.Arsene: A delayed upwards hand swing in tandem with Joker's last hit.
Like Sheik and Greninja's up aerial, the move's hitboxes are positioned high on Joker's legs, making it difficult to hit small or medium-sized fighters and has a very low damage output, only  dealing 6% without Arsene. However, the looping hits use the autolink angle; as a result, it can be used to drag opponents down consistently to extend combos. With Arsene, a full hop up air can KO at around 110%. Seems to resemble Joker spinning in the opening cinematic for Persona 5."
"2250","Joker","Down aerial","","8%/8%","Joker: An upside-down knife swing with a bit of delay before the swipe, similarly to Marth's down aerial.Arsene: A delayed foot stomp that comes out a couple of frames after Joker's attack, instead of at the same time like his other moves. Unlike Joker's attack, it meteor smashes opponents.
Somewhat of a niche move due to its lack of safety and startup, down air occasionally sees use as a crossup tool. With Arsene, it is a powerful all-purpose move due to its hitbox duration, combo potential and meteor smashing properties."
"2251","Joker","Grab","","—","Reaches out with one arm. All of Joker's throws have him toss the opponent with a blue energy. Unlike his other moves, Arsene does not affect the power of Joker's throws."

"2256","Joker","Down throw","","7%","Magically slams the opponent onto the ground while posing and flourishing his left arm, sending the opponent bouncing upwards. An effective combo starter that can combo into aerials. It can also initiate long combo strings of falling up aerial's looping hits into grab, or Grappling Hook into followups.

As such, they cannot be reflected or blocked by the shields of all versions of Link or Hero. The shots decay in damage and knockback based on the opponent's distance from Joker, dealing no knockback at the furthest distance. The button can be held to fire multiple times; additionally, Joker can dodge between shots by tilting the control stick horizontally, with each use causing the dodge to slow down (much like a roll or sidestep). If he is in midair, he can either fire in a circle around himself (in a similar fashion to Bayonetta's Bullet Arts up aerial) by tilting up, or below himself in a corkscrewing fashion by tilting down. On the ground, Joker can also press the jump button to perform a diagonal jump while rapidly firing shots downwards. When Arsene is out, it becomes Gun Special, where it fires three bullets with each shot for the standard version, and two bullets per shot for the aerial downward version. Both Gun and Gun Special have penetrative properties, meaning they can pass through multiple opponents. The closest version of Gun can also lock opponents."

It deals little initial damage, but curses opponents and inflicts further damage over time. Each use causes Joker to hover slightly. When Arsene is present, it becomes Eigaon, which travels faster and farther, has an area of effect on hit, hits multiple times, has higher knockback, and deals further damage over time. Eiha has low knockback, but due to it being vertical it can function as a niche KO option near the upper blast line."
"2263","Joker","Up special","Grappling Hook/Wings of Rebellion","Grappling Hook: 11% (grounded), 5% (aerial)Wings of Rebellion: 0%","Shoots out a grappling hook at an upward angle. It functions as a tether recovery. As an attack, the grounded version can grab opponents, dragging them towards Joker and launching them above himself with low ending lag and knockback, making it a reliable combo starter. The aerial version cannot grab and only deals low vertical knockback, but can act as a niche KO option at the upper blast line. However, the hook can be difficult to use due to its small size and hitbox position, and much like Isabelle's Fishing Rod, Grappling Hook can be shielded despite its grab properties. When Arsene is out, it becomes Wings of Rebellion, where Joker flies upwards or at a angle (again depending on input) using Arsene's wings. It has no hitboxes, therefore dealing no damage or knockback, but grants a relatively long period of intangibility on startup (frames 1-25 if used on the ground; frames 3-25 if used in midair). Wings of Rebellion also travels considerable distance, going higher than most recovery up specials and being able to recover far below the stage."

Its period can be extended for at least 1.5 seconds, and if an attack was successfully countered, Joker can perform a darkness-infused backhanded swipe at the end of the move to weakly launch opponents away. When Arsene is out, it becomes Tetrakarn against melee attacks and Makarakarn against projectiles, countering and reflecting them respectively. Both Tetrakarn and Makarakarn are extremely powerful, and have some of, if not the best startup, endlag, and damage of all other counters and reflectors, especially given the near universal nerfs to counters in Ultimate, having extremely generous frame data and damage multiplier. With a four frame startup for all variants, Rebel's Guard is a highly useful defensive option."

If he misses, Joker can also rush backwards if the control stick is pushed backwards. If any fighter is hit during either of these swipes, they are attacked by Joker and three other Phantom Thieves. (The two possible groups are Ann, Ryuji, and Morgana and Makoto, Haru, and Yusuke.) They then rush at the opponent quickly, with either Futaba or Morgana commenting on the attack. After the barrage is complete, Joker lands in front of the opponent as the screen changes into a splash screen, with Joker in the front gripping his glove, the text ""The Show's Over"" appearing to the left, and the shadow of the unlucky fighter in the background, spewing sparkles. Causes an instant KO if the opponent was at 64% before Joker struck them when the cinematic is over. If the Final Smash's possible resulting KO is the final KO needed to win, the splash screen will remain throughout the victory screen. Arsene will not affect All-Out Attack."

This also means Zap can still somewhat be used without MP, although the sword swing only deals a measly 2%.Zapple: A longer electric bolt that is fired when the move is semi-charged. Has considerably long range and deals decent damage, making it an excellent tool for spacing.

Kazap also has super armor frames and deceptively low ending lag.

It is somewhat slow on startup for a tilt (11 frames), however it has impressive knockback, being able to KO grounded opponents under 150%. The move also has a fairly large hitbox above Banjo which can make for an effective anti-air, and despite its power it has fairly low ending lag, which combined with its vertical launch angle can allow it to set up for juggles. However, it has a very short horizontal hitbox, making it difficult to hit grounded opponents who aren't directly touching the duo. Unlike the duo's other attacks, Kazooie possesses a hurtbox during this move."

It is a semi-spike with good range, and its low angle and decent duration makes it a good edgeguarding tool. It lowers Banjo's hurtbox to an even greater extent than his crouch, enabling him to duck under some moves like Wolf's Blaster shots. Conversely, its power and speed are poor, being the duo's slowest tilt attack at 12 frames. Is capable of crossing up against shields."

"2307","Banjo & Kazooie","Down smash","","15%","Banjo slams a fist down while Kazooie slams her wings downwards to the sides, similar to Palutena's down smash. Both the front and back hits deal the same amount of damage and knockback. Hits on frame 13 and has the fastest interruptibility out of the duo's smash attacks, while having good power despite its speed, being able to KO at the edge at around 85%.

Has a wide hitbox with good range, with the first hit being able to hit grounded opponents if performed while the duo are falling. Additionally, it is very fast in general, as the first hit begins at frame 7, while also being interruptible extremely early; this allows the duo to perform up to four up aerials while using their jumps, similar to Meta Knight's up aerial strings. Easily juggles into itself at low percents, and can even lead into other aerials such as forward air. However, it has very low hitstun due to its low damage, making the move easily escapable. Additionally, the first hit may occasionally launch opponents away from the second hit, and the move is extremely weak, having almost no KO potential even at high percents."

The move lasts for an extremely long time, usually making offstage use an inevitable self-destruct, though it is possible to recover if it is used from high enough. It is mostly useful for returning to stage quickly, as the non-meteor smashing hitbox is unable to KO past realistic percents. However, the meteor smashing hitbox can be used for followups on grounded opponents at high percents, and can act as a powerful sacrificial KO offstage."

These eggs will obey gravity, bounce off the ground and linger for quite some time (around the length of half of Final Destination) before breaking on their own, and become weaker as time passes. It is rather slow to fire, making the projectile mostly suited for stage control. If the special button is held, the duo will instead perform the Breegull Blaster, where Banjo takes Kazooie out of his backpack and uses her in a manner similar to a Super Scope. In this mode, pressing either attack button will cause Kazooie to quickly fire smaller, weaker straight-flying eggs that travel a third of Final Destination; subsequent eggs gradually travel shorter distances and deal less damage. These smaller eggs cause minimal flinching at long range and weak vertical knockback up close. Banjo can move and triple jump freely while in this mode, and can turn around (the latter is not possible while firing). Crouching or shielding will put Kazooie away. Due to the mechanics of this move, Egg Firing can only be done repeatedly if the player button mashes, since holding the button transitions into the Breegull Blaster."

To compensate, it has a large amount of strengths: the move grants full invincibility from the start of the dash (frame 18) to the end, including immunity to Final Smashes (that don't grab the opponent), the clean hit deals a high amount of damage and knockback, and can KO at the edge at 60%, while the late hit can kill effectively offstage. It works very well as a horizontal recovery option, as it does not cause helplessness and travels an excellent amount of horizontal distance. However, the duo can be grabbed during the dash despite its invincibility, and its high startup and ending lag makes it punishable if it misses or is shielded, which is compounded by the move's reduced shieldstun, especially on the late hit. If they attempt to use it without any feathers remaining, they simply stumble over; an aerial use will cause them to fumble in midair, and using it close to the ground will cause Banjo to land face first in his floored animation."
"2325","Banjo & Kazooie","Up special","Shock Spring Jump","3% (Pad)","Spawns a Shock Spring Pad underneath the duo, launching them upward. The longer the special button is held, the more height they gain. Slows the duo's descent upon starting up if used in the air. Mid-air jumps and airdodges are still usable as the duo aren't put into a helpless state. In the air, the pad itself acts as a projectile after its use, like Sonic's Spring Jump, which can gimp recoveries; unlike that move however, a grounded Shock Spring Pad cannot be used again by opponents or the duo."
"2326","Banjo & Kazooie","Down special","Rear Egg","9.22%","Banjo bends over, and Kazooie appears out of Banjo's backpack, firing a Grenade Egg from her rear behind the duo. The Grenade Egg has a fixed timer of around two seconds, and has a floaty, slightly unpredictable bouncing trajectory which varies based on where the egg lands when it hits the ground. Only one Grenade Egg can be fired at a time; if the move is used while an egg is already active, Kazooie will pop her head out from Banjo's backpack and shake her head profusely. Can be picked up, thrown and dropped like an item, similar to Hand Grenade. Grenade Eggs do very little knockback, although their short fuses allow for creative item play. Using the move in midair will stall the duo slightly and makes it easy to catch an aerial egg, and can be used to stall in midair much like Snake and his C4."
"2327","Banjo & Kazooie","Final Smash","The Mighty Jinjonator","10% (initial hit), 54.3% (total)","The duo summons the Jinjonator statue in front of them, dealing damage to anyone it hits. A cutscene then shows the Jinjonator bursting from the statue while Banjo and Kazooie watch in awe, before the opponent is tackled multiple times by the Jinjonator, followed by a final tackle that is accompanied by multiple Jinjos. Notably, it can only hit one opponent, much like Dede-Rush."
